			HighSpeed Help Accessory
                        ------------------------


1. Introduction
---------------

The new HighSpeed Pascal Help Accessory, in the following referred to
as HHA, is an accessory that provides you with a gateway to the HighSpeed
Pascal on-line help system, when you are operating outside the HIDE.


2. Installation
---------------

Installing HHA requires two things.

First, copy HHA.ACC and HHA.CFG to the root-directory of your boot-drive.

Second, modify HHA.CFG so that the first line in this file contains the
name of the directory in which the PASCAL.HLP file is located:

If PASCAL.HLP is located in the directory C:\PASCAL, then the  first line
in HHA.CFG must read: C:\PASCAL.


3. Starting HHA
---------------

After HHA has been installed, and your machine rebooted, HHA can be
activated by clicking on "HighSpeed Help" in the desk menu.


4. Operating HHA
----------------

HHA is operated via a mixture of mouse and keyboard commands.

Keyboard:

	Key			  Operation
        -----------------         -----------------------
        Help			= Show start-up help page
        Undo			= Show previous help page
        ESC			= Close HHA
        F1			= Page down
        F2			= Page up
        Home		   	= Beginning of help page
        Shift+Home	   	= End of help page
        Tab		   	= 8 columns right
        Shift+Tab        	= 8 columns left
        Arrow down		= Line down
        Arrow up		= Line up
        Arrow left		= Column left
        Arrow right 		= Column right
        Shift+Arrow down 	= Page down
        Shift+Arrow up   	= Page up
        Shift+Arrow left 	= 8 columns left
        Shift+Arrow right	= 8 columns right
	Ctrl+S			= Save block to disk

Mouse:

Double-clicking with the left mouse button, when the cursor is standing
on an underlined word, will provide help on the underlined word.

Pressing down the left mouse button, and at the same time moving the
cursor around, will mark a block.


4.1 Blocks
----------

Marking a block in HHA is done in much the same way as in the HIDE.

The only noticeable difference is that HHA marks blocks on a line-boundary,
as opposed to HIDE where blocks can be single words, even single letters.

Once a block has been marked, it can be saved on disk, by pressing CTRL and
S at the same time. HHA automatically names the block, using a combination
of the window title and '.HLP'. An example:

	You are currently getting help on the GEMVDI unit.
        You mark a block.
        You press CTRL and S.

        The saved block will be named: 'GEMVDI' + '.HLP' = GEMVDI.HLP

If HHA finds a file with the same name as the block, you will be prompted
before HHA overwrites the existing file.

If HHA was able to successfully save the block on disk, the block will be
de-marked.


5. Errors
---------

The HHA recognizes the following error situations:

1. The PASCAL.HLP file cannot be located.

   Modify (or create) the HHA.CFG file, and put it into the same directory
   as HHA.ACC. The contents of HHA.CFG must be the name of the directory
   in which the PASCAL.HLP file is located.


2. The PASCAL.HLP file has been removed (from the disk drive).

   Insert the disk containing PASCAL.HLP into the disk drive.


3. No available windows.

   Close a window, and try again.


4. Insufficient disk space.

   Make some room on the disk, so that the currently marked block
   can be saved, or make the block smaller.
