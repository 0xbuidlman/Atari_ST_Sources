This code was coded just for fun some weeks just to test if I could code
a line rout that was faster than TAMs line rout without the blitter chip.
I made version 1.0 in less than fourty minutes and that one made 6 lines
from corner to corner.   I then made version 1.1 that made 7 lines.
TAMs line rout was then a little bit faster when drawing horizontal lines
so I added another horizontal rout and optimized some more and version 1.2
saw the light of the day.   It do now make 7.5 lines from corner to corner.
And is a title bit faster then TAMs rout when drawing verticaly lines.
TAM says that hes line rout is faster on horizontal lines,  but I think
they are pretty even.
