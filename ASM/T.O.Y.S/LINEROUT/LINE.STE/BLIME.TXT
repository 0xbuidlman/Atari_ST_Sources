		   'B'litter 'LI'ne tecnique by 'ME'

		    Coded by:   PeyloW of T.O.Y.S.		   


This line tecnique was invented by ME this eastern this very year.
MEs rout was able to draw 25 lines from corner to corner,  but needed
one code for every possible line,   this would require some hundred
meg of RAM so he gived up the idea but told me about it first (PeyloW).
I found out that the idea was briliant so I sat down and tried to find
out a way to make a rout that would work for all different kind of lines.
After some few days I had finnished the firs rout witch made all lines
between 270 and 328 degrees.   Four days later I had made all four routs
that was needed to do all kinds of lines and the final rout made 14.5
lines from corner to corner (0,0-319,199).
I have not optimized this code yet,   and I have not even found out how
I could do that yet.

Well I have desided to spread this line rout under the following
restrictions: 
1.	If you use any of this code then you must 
	mention me (PeyloW of T.O.Y.S.) as the coder.
2.	You may not use this in any production of any 
 	kind untill 95-03-01.
3.	You may not delete this file when spreading.


Well, if you ever would code a faster line rout than this one then please
contact me.
You can contact me for any other reason as well on this address:

Ps.
	Our demo called 'Design Sucks' will be released this
	X-mas.   As you might guess we care more about superb
	code than good design,   so that is what you gonna 
	get.   Well we have not totaly forgotten to add some
	design so it will be a pleasure for your eyes as well.
