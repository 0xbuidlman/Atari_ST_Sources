			\ DNS-CACHE 1.0 for STiK /
			--------------------------
			(c)Pierre LALOE 27/IV/1997

	Latest version at : http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/1209/visual41.html

			 -- Shareware program --
			 V.A. 4.5 license : 0003
			 -----------------------

	This little program works on all MC68030 machines (Falcon OK ... was
not tested on TT) and is written with 100 % of system calls.
	It works as a TSR, but must be launched only when all STiK functions
are installed (in particular after accessory loading !)

	In theory, I should recommend you to load it BEFORE enabling STIK &
before DIALING ... You know memory corruption, CAB_OVL and STiK are good Friends,
but in fact it is better to load it after everything (including dialing) just before
launching CAB : try it !
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This program lets you save time and money, when using any program based
on the STiK accessory ! (CAB under GEM, Newsie ...)
	It will intercept the STiK *resolve calls (resolve and g_resolve)
	It operates as a DNS Hosts caching agent, i.e. : if one program asks to
resolve a host, and if that host has its address already resolved in the cache
database, then DNSCACHE will return the address written in its caching file, saving
you a long ans costy network resolving call.

This program will have the following behavings :
	1- Intercept Stik *resolve calls
	2- Look into caching database to see if the host asked is present :
	2.1-   if yes : send back the resolved adress without accessing the network !
	2.2-   if no ask Stik to resolve it and then
	2.2.1-    write it to the cache database for further access
	2.2.1-    send the result back to caller

	As on the Internet a host address can change, you are responsible for
deleting the database file at regular time intervals. I do not want to take this
responsability for you : you use this file the way you want !
	One thing only, the format is :
	1) the hostname in *lowercase* !!
	2) one or more TAB
	3) the dotted address, i.e : 4 numbers and 3 dots
	4) RC LF

	The caching file, for version 1.0 is located in C:\HOSTS.DB
	It WILL NOT work with the MINT_OVL for Cab as the Network calls are in
the executable ! (I'm trying to do something for that)

	You can use it to go to sites where a crashing "resolving host" didn't permit
you before, you just have to put the already resolved adress in the database and it
works. For example www.geocities.com crashes a lot of browsers (even Netscape) and
using this method you can go there !
	Of course, getting the already resolved adress is up to you. (linux for instance)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The demo version of this program is distributed via the Internet and
shall be copied and tested by whoever wants so.
	Well, the restriction in the DEMO version, is to ommit the 2.2.1 point
in the algorythm described upper. This implies that you will save a "resolving host"
access only if you put by hand the right address in the database file
	=> You can test but ... its not convenient for a normal use !

	The registration costs 50 French Francs.
	The registered users will receive the latest version and possibly part of
the source code if they wish to use it (if possible).
	They will receive the next releases for FREE !

	I AM AN ASSEMBLER 680x0 CODER FOR PLEASURE, I shall encourage you to do
the same !

	Visual Assembler once, Visual Assembler forever !
