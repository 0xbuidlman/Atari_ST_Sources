-	Version 1.07 on 26-sep-1993.
Drag'n drop protocol is supported (as command-line emulation only).
Preferences are now in ASCII, allowing easier update to new version.
Matrix management is now in good shape. It seems useable. (see doc).
Disassembly and memory windows refetch while running is (really) faster.
Context is refetched when opening a new context window (registers,
stack, Host regs, SSI regs). It was done only with memory windows (disassembly
and memory dump).
Popup management has been improved and 16 colors are selectable for styles.
Box windows redraw is faster.
Grab context option has been added (see doc).
Fill address in FILL box is updated after the action is completed. This allows
to make faster multiple sequential fills.

-	Version 1.06 on 9-may-1993.
Some help files have changed.
File management reduces pathnames (xx\yy\.. -> xx\).
Set help path in Preferences help fileselect.
Changed the alert box "DSP is not responding" and replaced "Dummy" button with
"Reset" button. DSPDebug is now directly in Dummy mode when no DSP driver is
present.
Registers window:
	It has been redesigned to offer a nicer view for OMR and SR, and for other purposes.
	Single-clicking on registers names (bold) directly brings an evaluate window
	(setup for setting a new value for that register).
	Single-clicking on a bit name (like T for instance) toggles the bit's state.
	Single-clicking on a bit combination (like I) cycles up its value.
Disassembly window:
	Labels in operand fields are now underlined. Double-clicking on one leads to
	its address if in P memory, or if not opens a dump window at this address.
	Context buttons state now reflects reality. This removes the trace bug that
	happened while clicking too fast on the I button.
Source window:
	Added "Src:" before source name in window title.
Variables window:
	Reduced value digits to 6.
Fixed bug in Evaluator (setting 48-bits & 56-bits regs with value>0xffffffff).
Fixed WITH tedinfo in FILL box to 6 digits.
Hardware (Host and SSI) registers are now correctly updated when changed in
their windows.
Corrected a side effect in in-line help for CRD2 in SSI box.
	(thanks to RJ Ridder & Wilfred Kilwinger (Atari Ben.))

Changed cld2lod.ttp to output EQUates in LOD debug symbols (with the E type,
which is not a 'legal' LOD symbol type). See new documentation for using it in
DSPDebug.

(Matrix control is not finished yet...)
