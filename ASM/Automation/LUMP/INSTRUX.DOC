
Instructions for 'Lump-Chunking' a game/demo etc.
-------------------------------------------------

In order to start Lump-Chunking a disk, you will need three things.

1) The original source of the game/demo - please note that the word original
   is not meant as in 'original packaging etc.', but as in the files are all  
   unpacked, but the protection has been removed.  Eg. Use an Empire or any
   other type of crack where the files are NOT packed.

2) Two blank disks.  The Joiner program will not successfully work from
   a hard-drive - it usually ends up bombing (with 4 bombs!).  I assume that
   this will be fixed in the 'forthcoming GEM version' ???


Right, you're now ready to start Lumping.
-----------------------------------------

i) Copy all the DATA files to one of your blank disks.  That is all the
   files except for the program file.  Also do not copy any .RSC files to
   the disk - as this file type is not supported in ANY Trap #1 loader,
   because resource files are loaded via TRAP #2 - common sense really !!

ii) Run the 'JOINIT.PRG' and insert the disk you've just prepared with all
    the files on it.  The joiner program will load in all the files on your
    disk, then it will ask you to insert another disk (this is where your
    other disk comes into play).  It's best to use a blank formatted disk.
    The joiner program is now asking for a filename.  A new file containing
    all the previous multitudes of files will be saved to your disk - 
    providing that no errors occur !!  DO NOT type in a folder name, as the
    input routine is only looking for a maximum of 11 characters !! 

iii) Load up the Automation Packer v2.51, and pack the one large file with the
     Chunk option using whichever compression type & chunk size you can be
     bothered waiting for !!  Ie.  The best compression & a 32K chunk size will
     take a bloody long time, so go and watch a good film !!

iv) Now pack the executable program with a good packer.  It doesn't have to
    be the Automation Packer - so if you've got no patience and the program
    file is a big bastard then use the JAM Packer/Ice Packer v2.31 !!!  These
    beauts only take approx. 3-4 minutes to pack 200K+ files !!!

v) Now to the source code.  This is pretty self-explanatory, but here goes
   anyway.  Load up GENST v2.20(or later versions) and alter the filename
   under 'srch' to the filename of the large data file.  Alter the filename
   under 'GAM' to the program file.  Alter the chunk size & the no. of files
   open to their required values.  The 'files open at once' value is best left
   at 10 if you are doing a game that loads in all the files and doesn't
   access the disk any further !!  And finally alter your message to
   'Joe Bloggs presents blah! blah!' etc.

vi) Assemble the above source code to your second disk.  This disk should now
    contain your Lumped file, your packed executable file and the assembled
    loader.  Run it and make sure it works - if it doesn't then go back to
    your source code and increase the 'files open at once' value.  If it
    still doesn't work, then remove obvious filenames like 'HISCORE' and
    'SAVEGAME' etc.  You will have to use a bit of common sense if you want
    to succeed.  Any files that are not used within the main body of the
    lumped file, should be listed after the 'srch' filename in the source
    code - follow the example file, and DON'T FORGET THE EXTRA ZEROS !!


vii) Shove the (working) result onto your menu disk !!!
