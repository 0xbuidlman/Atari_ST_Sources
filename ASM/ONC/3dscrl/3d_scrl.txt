     YO! This is OGGE of ONC speaking.
Included in this folder should be the files: 3D_SCRL.TXT (this one), 
3D_SCRL.S and 3DSCRPIC.PI1.

 If you have these three files just load the 3D_SCRL.S into your 
DevPac, assemble it and suffer! It is just a simple example of 
how many scrollers are made nowadays.

 To be able to show you the techique without having you stealing 
my code I made the routine very slow (it takes about 76% of CPU 
time, TIMER B included).

 What the program does is really very simple. The picture 
includes a four bitplane pattern (15 colours plus background). 
The letters are divided into sixteen segments of wich one is 
always black (background). By putting colours in the other 
fifteen segments you can create a completely different pattern 
from the one in the picture. You can light one segments and have 
the others black etc. When putting lots of these patterns on top 
of each other it will turn out to be very similar to normal 
pixel-drawing.

 Well, anyway, if you are a good enough coder to put routines 
like this to use I think you can also understand what I'm talking 
about and (hopefully) optimize the code quite a bit.

 Just to put your hacking brains to work I have not made the text 
routines (and I didn't want to waste to much time making a font
that will never be used).

     Have fun and keep hackin'!!!
