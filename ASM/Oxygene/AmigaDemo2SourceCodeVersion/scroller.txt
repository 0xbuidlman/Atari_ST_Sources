                      DID YOU REALLY EXPECT A DIFFERENT FONT FOR AN AMIGA DEMO?
  WELCOME TO THE AMIGA DEMO 2 BY OXYGENE, ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AFTER AMIGA DEMO BY TEX!

  USE ARROW KEYS TO SELECT A TUNE AND SPACE OR RETURN TO PLAY IT.  PRESS "N" KEY FOR NEXT SONG (SHUFFLE MODE)    

  THIS FINAL VERSION BRINGS YOU NEW FEATURES: (1) A HD FILE VERSION FOR THOSE WHO DISLIKE FLOPPIES    (2) 16-BITS SOUND QUALITY ON FALCON   (3) 50KHZ MIXING ON MEGA-STE, TT AND FALCON)       
  
  PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS DEMO ON REAL HARDWARE FOR BEST SOUND QUALITY (STE, MEGA-STE, TT, FALCON AND CT60 ARE SUPPORTED). IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO USE EMULATOR, USE SAINT 2.12 OR LATER FOR BEST EXPERIENCE (BUT AGAIN, PLEASE TRY THE SOUND QUALITY ON REAL HARDWARE)

     THANKS TO DISK SYSTEM AND PACKER YOU CAN ENJOY 3 HOURS AND 6 MINUTES OF DIGITAL MUSIC ON A SINGLE FLOPPY DISK.
  YOU CAN ENJOY 76 AMIGA MUSICS. THERE IS NO "CLASSIC" MODULE MAINLY BECAUSE THERE ALREADY IS TONS OF MODULE COMPILATION.    I PREFER THESE SMALL AND SYNTHETIC TUNES . IT NEEDS FINE PLAYER AND ACCURATE EMULATION TO SOUND AS THE ORIGINAL.   EVEN IF ALL SONGS ARE GREAT, MY FAVE ARE ALIEN-BREED, BLITZ, ECONOMY12, KITWANKER, RINGS OF MEDUSA, SHITCHIP, TECHNOCHIP AND WONDEREW. (I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE GREAT ALIEN BREED MUSIC)


          THIS DEMO WAS DONE AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR MY NEW AMIGA PAULA EMULATOR. MY EMULATOR RUNS AMIGA MUSIC WITHOUT MODIFYING ANY DATA (NO SAMPLE PRE-LOOP, 
NO SAMPLE CONVERSION)   JUST GET THE ORIGINAL MUSIC DRIVER SOURCE CODE AND ONLY CHANGE FEW LINES OF CODE (REPLACE WRITE ACCESS TO DFF000 WITH SOME TRAP INSTRUCTIONS)
     YOU CAN GET THE SOURCE CODE OF MY PAULA EMULATOR ON MY WEBSITE:     HTTP://LEONARD.OXG.FREE.FR


       THE EMULATOR IS FOCUSED ON SOUND QUALITY.   IT RUNS AT 25 KHZ OVER THE STE DIGITAL OUTPUT.  IT RUNS AT 50KHZ ON MEGA-STE, TT, FALCON OR CT60.  
    THE FALCON USE 16-BITS MODE FOR BEST QUALITY.    THERE IS ABSOLUTLY NO CLICK IN THE SOUND EACH FRAME, AS IT OFTEN APPAIRS IN OTHER STE DEMOS. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT STE DAC FREQUENCY AND VIDEO RATE ARE NOT PERFECTLY IN SYNC.  SOME PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT AND MISS ONE SAMPLE SOMETIME 
ON SOME FRAMES. IN THAT DEMO YOU STAY IN SYNC, EVEN ON STRANGE VIDEO RATE MACHINES SUCH AS TT OR FALCON.

      THAT DEMO INCLUDE THREE FAMOUS AMIGA MUSIC DRIVER: PRO-TRACKER (.MOD)    FUTURE COMPOSER (.FC)     SOUND-MONITOR (.BP)     

      THAT DISK CONTAINS MY LATEST DEMO DISK SYSTEM. IN MY NEW SYSTEM THE DISK IS FILLED TO DEATH. ONLY THE FIRST 204 BYTES OF THE DISK ARE NOT PACKED! EVERYTHING ELSE (KERNEL, DIRECTORY OR SCREENS) ARE PACKED. SO EVEN THE BOOTSECTOR IS SHORTER THAN A STANDARD BOOTSECTOR! (204 BYTES)

     BELIEVE ME OR NOT THIS IS MY FIRST 4 BITPLANS AND 4 PIXELS SCROLLER! I FIRST CODED A FAST SCROLLING ROUTINE USING THE STE VIDEO CAPABILITIES (SCREEN SPLITING) BUT IT APPAIRS IT IS NOT SUPPORTED ON TT. SO I TURNED BACK TO A SOFTWARE SCROLLER AND I WAS SURPRISED BY THE CPU TIME IT TAKES...


    LAST BUT NOT LEAST I WOULD LIKE TO THANKS ALL PEOPLE WHO TESTED THE DEMO ON REAL HARDWARE TO MAKE IT WORK ON ALMOST ALL ATARI MACHINES. A SPECIAL THANKS GO TO:  GGN, EVIL (DHS) AND CHRISTOS.

          ENJOY THE SOUND!    LEONARD, CHRISTMAS 2008!
