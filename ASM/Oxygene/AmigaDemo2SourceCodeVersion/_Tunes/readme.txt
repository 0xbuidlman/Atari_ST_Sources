note:
music files in that directory are generated by MusicInfo/MusicInfo.exe
That tool remove dupplicated samples between several tunes and produces a merged sound bank (FcSoundBank.bin & FcSoundBank.inc)
Then dupplicated samples are just "cleared" in music files so the file length does not change, and the packer will be happy to find tons of zero to pack :-)
