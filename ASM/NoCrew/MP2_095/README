This is the version 0.95 release of the MPEG Audio Layer II decoder
by Fredrik Noring and Tomas Berndtsson.

See NEWS for more news after version 0.9.

New features from version 0.9 are:

       * Dynamic buffer allocation
       * Config file
       * Find next song in the same directory
       * Skip to next and previous song
       * Fast forward
       * Songs with CRC now work
       * Keyboard control
       * Change if count down or up

Some bugs has also been fixed:

       * Pause now works all the time
       * On play, the player was sometimes silent

Features from version 0.7 are still worth mentioning:

       * Handshaked DMA transfers
       * GEM interface, also working as ACC
       * Several new options, including pause and stop
       * Sync detection and recovery routines
       * Clock detection
       * Count-down display
       * MiNT support, and several other systems

Although this program has been tested successfully with various MPEG songs,
no warranties comes with the program. We are not responsible for anything
it might do to you or your system. If it works well for you, we'll gladly
take the credit for it.

The program is a standalone program and it is also designed to work as
an accessory. Simply rename the PRG to ACC and put it where the rest of
your accessories are.

The config file (MP2AUDIO.CNF) should be placed either in the same
directory as the program or in the root of C:\. The program will first 
look for it in the program's directory and then C:\.
If no config file can be found or if an argument is invalid, the
default value(s) are used. The default values can be found in the
example config file.
Note that the config file is only loaded when the program is first
started. Therefore, if you run it as ACC, any changes in the config
file will only take place after a reboot or resolution change.

Here is a list of the keyboard controls:

  SPACE     -     Play/Stop
 Ctrl-l     -     (Load and) Play
 Ctrl-s     -     Stop
 Ctrl-o     -     Load (and don't play)
 Ctrl-p     -     Pause
 Ctrl-f     -     Next song
 Ctrl-b     -     Previous song
 Ctrl-v     -     Fast Forward
 Ctrl-r     -     Repeat on/off
 Ctrl-t     -     Count down/up
 Ctrl-i     -     Info
 Ctrl-u     -     Close top window

The player has been tested with both MultiTOS and oAESis running under
MiNT version 1.12, with and without NVDI 4.11, and of course normal TOS. 

The player supports the Drag & Drop protocol used in MultiTOS and other
desktops. This means you can drag a file from the desktop to the players
control window. If the Alternate key is held down when dropping, the 
player will only load the song, not start playing it. See the file BUGS!

In case the Drag & Drop protocol isn't supported, the player also works
with the VA_START message, used by at least Gemini and Thing. I have only
tested it with Thing, since I don't have Gemini. With VA_START, the song
always starts playing, but if you use Thing, it will use Drag & Drop as
first choice.

Currently, the resource file is only made for interlaced mode on RGB's 
and non-doublelined mode on VGA's. The program still works in other 
resolutions though.

The program normally detects if there is an external clock attached to 
the computer and uses it if so. Otherwise, the internal clock is used 
and a frequency conversion (linear interpolation) to 49.17 kHz is made 
by the DSP (this reduces sound quality significantly). This detection
may always be overridden by the FORCE_CLOCK argument in the config file.

Note that the frequency conversion takes some DSP time, thus high
bitrate (typically 192kbit/s) MPEGs might not work without an external 
clock.

In this version, the program will assume that the external clock, if any,
is a 44.1 kHz. If a 48 kHz, or any other, is used the song will probably
be played at that frequency. Other frequencies than 44.1 kHz might work,
we haven't tested it yet. The lyrics function is not yet implemented.

There is no special mailing list for this product, but the most appropriate
mailing list for asking questions or giving great ideas is
nocrew-nojunk@dd.chalmers.se.
You can also contact the authors of the program, see addresses below.


We are interested in what kinds of MPEG files that work, so if you are
able to play songs with bitrates lower than 128 kbit/s, or frequencies
others than 44.1 kHz, please let us know. Also, if you run it in other
systems than the normal and the ones listed above, such as N.AES, XaAES,
MagiC, whatever, let us know.

!! NOTE !! Only stereo songs work in this version!!

Thanks to Anders Eriksson for testing the program and his work on the
resource file, even if we changed most of the original resource.

Enjoy,
