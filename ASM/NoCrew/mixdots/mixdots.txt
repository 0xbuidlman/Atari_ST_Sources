This is actually three 128 byte demos in one package. They were so 
similar, that we thought we'd put them all together. One of them 
is an already built program, namely NOCREW.TOS. The other two are
created by running FINDFUJI.TOS, which will locate the Fujilogo
in your ROM and create two other programs, BLUEFUJI.TOS and
FADEFUJI.TOS.

In case you would fail running the FINDFUJI.TOS program, I have
included the demos created on my machine, which has TOS 4.04.

Run all these demo in 320x2[40]0xTC mode on a Falcon. 
None of them requires an FPU.

The sources to all three demos can be found in the SOURCES/ dir.
