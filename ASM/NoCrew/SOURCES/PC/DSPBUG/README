This diskette contains a compacted copy of DSPBUG, a standalone debug monitor for the Motorola DSP56000/1 digital signal processor.  DSPBUG is written in DSP56000/1 assembly code and allows the user to develop applications on a real time system.  Although DSPBUG is the monitor supplied with the Motorola DSP56000/1 EXP experimental board, it may also be imbedded in a prototype design to provide debugging and testing facilities.Copy the file DSPBUG.EXE from the floppy disk to a convenient location on a hard disk.  "Execute" the file on the hard disk by entering DSPBUG.  The file will then expand into its constituent parts.  You will need about 588k bytes of hard disk space to accommodate the expanded files.
