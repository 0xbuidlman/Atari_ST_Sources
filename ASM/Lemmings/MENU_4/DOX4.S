 INSTRUCTIONS:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The gems transfer like this:

                          So, the gem in the middle transfers two steps, while
                   the others only one step.
             1           
       To complete a level you have to make a figure
       1    2    1    similar to the right one.
     
             1          Remember to look at the figure in the middle all
                   the time (Shows what colour the gem will have
                          when you transfer it).

                        Use left mouse to transfer, right to 'undo' 
                        (Don't use undo too much, your moves are not
                        unlimited).   

 Remember when transferring a purple gem, it will disappear if you have it in
 the middle and if the purple gem is surrounded with golden gems, they will
 disappear as well (Just watch the figure in the middle, remember ?) 

 If a stage is too hard, press RETURN to go to next stage. This can only be
 done a couple of times (Less times on the higher levels).

 Okay, now for the digits and other stuff at the top of the screen:

 1:The one at the top is how many moves you have on the current screen.

 2:The one below is how many times you can press return, or loose a screen.

 3:The one below the one above is how many screens you must complete until
   you can select another level/cave.

 Oh, and on the title screen press return to select controls/# of players.
 (play with mouse it's better...)
