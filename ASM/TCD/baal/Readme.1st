After digging this code up I cannot remember why I did this so try it with and without the excluded lines of code.  But trust me, it will work.

The technique I used to file game was to get the main code into memory and find out which address loads the data from the disk.  Once the data has been loaded it is then saved to a file with a unique file name based on which tracks were loaded.  Each of these data files were then packed with SpeedPack 3.  A fast file loader to load these data files was then patched (the address of it) into the main code so that every time the game tries to load tracks and sectors my file loader jumps in instead.

The file loader was ripped from Chaos Engine, which I also cracked, and then depacked using the SP3 depack code.  So it's a bit of a pic 'n' mix of techniques, but it works which is all I wanted.
