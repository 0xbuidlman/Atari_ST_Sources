NEW MODE - COURTESY OF UGLY AND PERVERT SCROLLERS - IS VERY PROUD TO
 PRESENT YOU:

--- THE SNURKEL TWISTER ---
                        $
PROGRAMMED AT THE END OF AUGUST 1990 IN A PERIOD OF EXTREME HEAT,
 THE SCROLLTEXT IS WRITTEN ON SEPTEMBER 14TH, 1990...
                        $
I'LL REVEAL HOW TO GET TO THE HIDDEN SCREEN, BUT NOT HERE, YOU'LL
 HAVE TO READ THIS SCROLLER TILL THE END... HE HE HE
                        $
I'LL EVEN LET MY LITTLE BROTHER WRITE SOME WORDS HERE JUST TO INCREASE
 YOUR PAINS...  I'M SADASTIC EH?
                        $
THIS IS THE LITTLE BROTHER OF NEW MODE HERE: HI! MY NAME IS FRANK, I'M 15,
 AND I HAVE AN AMIGA.
                        $
I WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT MOST OF THE DEMOSCREENS IN THIS DEMO.
                        $
GREETINGSSCREEN: I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE ATARI SIGNS. IN THIS DEMO THERE ARE VERY
 GOOD LOGOS. FOR EXAMPLE: TEX, THE CAREBEARS (VERY NICE BEAR), SYNC
 (NICE HEADS), ST-NEWS (GOOD COLORS).
                        $
NOW TO SCREEN COLORSHOCK: I THINK IT IS THE BEST SCREEN MY BROTHER EVER 
MADE. THIS COLORSHOCK BEATS EVERYTHING.
                        $
NOW TO THE GAME SOKOBAN: A VERY GOOD GAME. ON THE PC THE GAME WAS A HIT.
 VERY NICE IS THE SMILEY.
                        $
NOW TO GAME TWO MATCH-IT: I WAS THE TESTER OF THIS GAME. ALWAYS WHEN MY
 BROTHER HAD FINISHED A NEW VERSION OF THIS GAME, I HAD TO TEST IT. I WAS
 HAPPY WHEN MY BROTHER FINISHED THE GAME.
                        $
SO THAT'S ALL FOR THE GAMES. NOW TO THE NEXT SCREEN, THE BIG BORDER:
 THIS IS THE UGLIEST SCREEN OF THE DEMO. SUCH A SHIT!!! EVERYBODY WANTS
 SEE MORE OF A SCREEN. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT CHAOS CAN PROGRAMM SUCH A SHIT.
 HIS GAME WAS VERY GOOD. THIS IS THE LOUSIEST SCREEN IN THE DEMO.
                        $
NOW LET'S GO TO THE RESET-SCREEN: THIS SCREEN HAS VERY GOOD COLORS AND A
 VERY GOOD MUSIC.
                        $
SO THAT'S ALL FOR THE SYNTAX-TERROR DEMO. NOW I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
 THE MEMBERS OF DELTA FORCE: THE FIRST ONE IS NEW MODE (MY BROTHER), HE
 IS SOMETIMES OK, BUT SOMETIMES VERY CRAZY. EVERY DAY I MUST
 HEAR HIS SHIT MUSIC FROM THE CD, FOR EXAMPLE: TECHNOTRONIC,SNAP,
 SKINNY PUPPY AND ALL THIS SHIT LIKE THAT. THE NEXT ONE IS SLIME: HE IS
 LIKE NEW MODE. THEY ARE LIKE BROTHERS. THEY HEAR THE SAME MUSIC AND
 EVERYTHING ELSE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT CHAOS. AND NOW
 TO QUESTLORD.HE HAS VERY LONG HAIR HE LOOKS LIKE A GIRL! BUT HE ISN'T
 SO CRAZY AS NEW MODE AND SLIME. SO THAT'S ALL FOR THE MEMBERS OF DELTA
 FORCE. 
                        $
NOW I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT OTHER GROUPS. LET'S BEGIN: THE CAREBEARS.
 I THINK THEY ARE THE BEST DEMO CODERS. THE FULLSCREEN IN CUDDLYS WAS SUPER.
 THE SOUNDS FROM AN COOL ARE VERY GOOD!
                        $
THAT IS ALL FOR THE CAREBEARS. NOW TO THE NEXT GROUP: TEX.  -ES-, HE IS
 THE BEST PAINTER ALL OVER THE WORLD.  MAD MAX, HE IS THE BEST MUSICIAN
 I KNOW. IN THE SYNTAX-TERROR DEMO ALL OF THE MUSICS ARE FROM HIM!
 BUT I DON'T LIKE HIS LONG HAIR. WHEN I SAW HIM IN A MAGAZINE I THOUGHT
 HE IS A WOMAN.
                        $
NOW I TALK SOMETHING ABOUT SOFTWARE FACTORIES:  THE FIRST ONE IS THALION.
 CHAMBERS OF SHAOLIN WAS NOT BAD. VERY GOOD WAS THE IDEA WITH THE CHAMBERS.
 I LIKE IF I CAN TRAIN MY FIGHTER. IN OTHER GAMES LIKE: 'INTERNATIONAL KARATE', YOU ONLY
 HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST TWO IDIOTS.   WINGS OF DEATH.  DARYL SENT MY BROTHER
 A DEMOVERSION OF THIS GAME. I HAVE PLAYED IT EVERY FREE HOUR I HAD. BUT IT
 IS SO DIFFICULT.
                        $
THE NEXT FACTORY I TALK ABOUT, IS HEWSON.   MY BROTHER AND I STILL WAIT
 FOR PARADROID 90. I KNOW THE GAME FROM THE C64. SO THAT'S ALL FOR HEWSON.
                        $
NOW TO ELECTRONIC ARTS: 'FLOOD' IS A VERY GOOD GAME. ESPECIALLY I LIKE IN
 THIS GAME THE LITTLE GUY WITH THE GLASSES. I WAIT FOR POWERMONGER. I HAVE
 READ IN POWERPLAY ABOUT THIS GAME AND I HOPE THEY MAKE A HIT.
                        $
NOW TO MICROPROSE. YOUR SIMULATIONS ARE SUPER. FOR EXAMPLE: SILENT SERVICE 2
 AND RAILROAD TYCOON. I'LL HOPE THEY MAKE THE ST/AMIGA VERSION OF THESE GAMES.
                        $
NOW I TALK ABOUT A GERMAN FACTORY: RAINBOW ARTS. YOUR TURRICAN WASN'T
 BAD.
                        $
NOW TO IMAGE WORKS: XENON 2-MEGABLAST WAS SUPER. AS I SAW THE GRAPHICS
 OF THIS GAME I FELL FROM MY SEAT. THE END MONSTERS ARE SO SUPER PAINTED.
 THIS GAME IS A MASTER PRODUCTION OF GRAPHICS. SO END OF TALK ABOUT FACTORIES.
                        $
MAMA MIJA! I WANTED TO WRITE A SHORT TEXT AND YET I WROTE A ROMAN. SO I
 SEND AT LAST GREETINGS TO ALL GROUPS ON THE ST AND AMIGA. BYE BYE......
