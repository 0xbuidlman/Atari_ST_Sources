      hello again boys and girls! dis time it's slime at the keyboard.....
........$ $ $ $      okay, first let me say that this screen was finished
 in december #4   1988    ^ - yes, you can believe that...... ` this screen is
 two years old (!!!). it wasn't copied from a lost boys
 screen (noooo!! surely not).     but let me stop with this unnecessary
 bullshit!   [\]         you sure see this little raster (if not, i think
 you have to go to an oculist) - this raster is the first one in
 atari history (i think so!) which is antialiased !!   now i've told you
 all about dis really little old screen and so i tell you a very old story
 about car driving: 'it was in october 1988 when three members of delta
 force (<, @ and me, >) drove with my car (a citroen 2cv - a
 'ente' or 'duck'?) from the south to tex' headquarter in the north
 of germany. i hope you can imagine how full my little 'duck' was with
 three persons, two computers (keyboard, floppy, monitor, harddisk
 and many disks) and our luggage for one week - it was really narrow.
 new mode and i changed in driving the car. it was new mode's turn as we
 met this 'friendly' truck driver. new mode misunderstood a sign of the
 trucker and nearly three members of delta force were gone to hell!! but
 not enough - the trucker (or should i say tanker) followed us to the next
 filling station and attacked my little 'duck' with a really big hammer
 (i fell bad when remember that). i got out of the car and now this maniac
 runs towards me by swinging the big big hammer. i nearly got a heart
 attack - but i managed to calm this asshole down (ask not how - i don't
 know it) and he went back to his truck.......' the moral of this story:
 'if i have had a gun (a pump gun or something else) i surely had sent
 this fucking son of a bitch to the cemetery - and i swear you, that next
 time such an ugly pig will not survive this because i will shoot
 his dimwited head in thousand pieces and mince and mangle the rest of
 the fucker - and that's no joke!!!!!    $ $$$ $    it's better i stop
 talking about that lamer before i forget me.... $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
  what do you think about my smilies? i painted them in a fever called
 'aaaaciiiiiiiiiid' ([\]) - but this time is over and out and i now hear
 music like 'nitzer ebb', 'front 242', 'sa 42', 'phillip boa and the
 voodooclub' and 'the aend' .............. well now it's
 time for my own personal greets (other people will be greeted in the
 fantastic greetings-screen) - okay, hi and hello to: $ joystick (or
 schnulzi - the only man with a higher joystick consumption as i have) $
 friese (the girl-eater) $ stonie (god) $ ludwig $ matze $ mike (the
 biggest man i know) $ conny $ cloud (the girl who made 2.800.000 points
 in twin cobra - hope that the score is not the old one) $ rossi $
 claus (seilerle - hahaha!) $      thats it for this time - you will
 read more of me in one of the other screens... o.k. let's wrap wrap wrap wra.
