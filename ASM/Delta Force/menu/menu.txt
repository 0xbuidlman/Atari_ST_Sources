                               
 HI GUYS! AFTER TWO LONG AND HARD YEARS OF WORK AND ABSOLUTE LAZYNESS,
 FINALLY HERE IT IS.........        THE SYNTAX TERROR DEMO           
 EXPECTED TO BE LOTSA BETTER AND SMALLER BUT AS YOU SEE, NOBODY'S PERFECT!
     MOST OF THE CODING BY NEW MODE AND MOST OF THE GRAPHICS BY SLIME
 (WITH SOME RIPPED FROM SOME AMIGA-DEMOS).    THIS MENU IS BORING LIKE HELL,
 BUT THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR SUCH AN UNSPECTACULAR MENU:    WE SIMPLY
 HAVE NO MORE MEMORY ON THE DISK (THERE ARE "JUST" 25 (!!!) SCREENS ON THIS
 DISK AND THIS MEANS THAT THE DEMO YOU'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IS THE BIGGEST
 DEMO EVER FIXED ON ONE SINGLE TEN SECTOR DOUBLE SIDED DISK!).
  THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO MORE SCREENS, ONE FROM GIGABYTE-CREW AND ONE
 FROM THE REPLICANTS. WE HAD NO MORE MEMORY FOR THOSE TWO SCREENS ON THE
 DISK (IF WE INCLUDED THEM WE NOW WOULD HAVE AN ELEVEN SECTOR DISK, AND
 THAT NOBODY WANTS TO, ARE WE RIGHT?).  SORRY TO THOSE TWO GROUPS, BUT IT
 WASN'T POSSIBLE... DON'T BE ANGRY!                 
   THIS DEMO IS -SHAREWARE-   IF YOU LIKE IT, PLEASE SEND US SOME MONEY. ALL
 PROFESSIONAL PD-LIBRARIES SHOULD GIVE US A BIT OF THE MONEY THEY EARN WITH
 THIS DEMO (THAT'S JUST FAIR!)                
 AS ALL GROUPS ALWAYS REPORT WHAT THEY USED DURING WORKING OUT THEIR DEMOS,
 WE WILL DO THE SAME RIGHT NOW...        WORK STARTED IN DECEMBER 1988,
 WORK ENDED IN DECEMBER 1990, THIS MAKES A TOTAL OF TWO YEARS OF WORK WITH
 SOME REALLY LONG DELAYS OF COMPLETE LAZYNESS.  THIS DEMO IS RELEASED ON
 THE ST-NEWS CODING CONFERENCE.     OK LET'S BEGIN THE LIST HERE.....
       LITRES OF LIQUIDS CONSUMED: AROUND 10000 LITRES       PIZZAS EATEN:
 AROUND 300        DISKS USED FOR STORAGE: 40 (FOR ALL GFX AND SOURCECODES)
    HARDDISK CRASHES: 4 (THREE BY NEW MODE, ONE BY CHAOS INC.)       PACKING TIME:
 TOO LONG, BUT AROUND TWO WHOLE DAYS       HARDWARE USED:   TWO MEGA ST4,
 ONE 520ST (1 MEG), ONE 260ST (1 MEG), ONE 1040STE (4 MEG),
 TWO AMIGA 500 (1 MEG), MANY DISKDRIVES, MANY MICE, MANY JOYSTICKS, MANY
 MONITORS (MAINLY THE COLOURED ONES BUT ALSO SOME MONOCHROME ONES), A CD-PLAYER (WITH MANY
 CD'S), A CASSETTE-RECORDER, SOME PRINTERS AND A SELF-CONSTRUCTED SOUNDSAMPLER.       SOFTWARE USED:
      TURBO-ASSEMBLER, SEKA-ASSEMBLER, DEVPAC V2.08, GFA-ASSEMBLER (NOT SO OFTEN),
 GFA-BASIC (JUST TO DO SOME SINE-CALCULATIONS), NEOCHROME V1.0 TO V2.18, CYBERPAINT 2,
 RIPPER V1.0 TO V3.1 (BY DELTA FORCE), TEMPUS EDITOR (TO WRITE SCROLLTEXTS), FCOPY V2.0 TO V3.0, COOLTOOL (BY
 DELTA FORCE), SPECTRUM 512 (MAINLY TO CONVERT AMIGA-PICS), PACK-ICE (THE BEST PACKER
 EVER), MARVIN (BY DELTA FORCE), SAMPLE-SOFTWARE BY M.BITTNER, RIPPER (AN AMIGA-PROGRAM) AND
 MANY OTHER TOOLS.               THIS DISK IS 82 TRACKS, 10 SECTORS, DOUBLE-SIDED.  IF YOU COPY IT, IT'S THE BEST
 THING TO DO IT WITH FCOPY. ALWAYS COPY -ALL SECTORS- (NOT JUST USED ONES!).                   
     IF YOU WANT TO CONTACT US FOR ANY REASON (DONATIONS, QUESTIONS, DEMO-SWAPPING...) PLEASE WRITE TO THE
 FOLLOWING ADDRESS (BUT DON'T SEND ANY PIRATED SOFTWARE! KEINE RAUBKOPIEN! WE WON'T ANSWER LETTERS WITH PIRATED SOFTWARE!):
 -    PLK 136681 E   -   7050 WAIBLINGEN    -    WEST-GERMANY   -        BUT PLEASE INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL REPLY COUPONS, OTHERWISE
 WE CAN'T ANSWER ALL LETTERS.  LETTERS FROM GIRLS WILL BE PREFERED!  ALL YOU GIRLS OUT THERE, PLEASE CONTACT US! WE WANT TO
 BE THE FIRST CREW WITH FEMALE MEMBERS. SO IF YOU'RE A GIRL AND YOU WANT TO BECOME A MEMBER OF DELTA FORCE, JUST DROP US A LETTER
 (IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU SEND A PHOTO TOO!).          SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW....     WE'RE DOING A PARTY NEXT YEAR (1991 IS
 MEANT HERE).   MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF OUR PARTY THIS YEAR CALLED I.C.C. 1.  YES? GREAT! THIS PARTY
 IS BY NO MEANS A COPYPARTY, NO PIRATES ARE ALLOWED, THERE'S NO HACKING AND
 CRACKING ON THIS PARTY, JUST CODING, PAINTING, DRINKING (HEAVY), EATING (MUCH), PLAYING, SWIMMING, CHATTING,
 AND HAVING LOTSA FUN IN GENERAL.  SO IF YOU'RE A FAMOUS DEMO-CREW, PLEASE
 CONTACT US FOR AN INVITATION.  BUT THE SPACE IS VERY VERY LIMITED SO WE
 CAN'T INVITE TOO MANY PEOPLE.  THIS IS NO MEGAPARTY IT'S JUST A TEENY-WEENY EVENT FOR THE EUROPEAN DEMO-ELITE.
         BUT WHY ARE DELTA FORCE NO MORE CRACKERS?   YES IT'S TRUE, WE'VE
 BEEN CRACKERS SOME YEARS AGO, BUT WE STOPPED ALL ACTIVITIES ON THE
 CRACKING SECTOR ONE YEAR AGO AND ARE NOW A PURE DEMO-CREW.  BUT WHY?
  JUST BECAUSE WE THINK CRACKING IS -NOT- GOOD FOR YOU. AND WE HAVE CONNECTIONS
 TO SOME GERMAN SOFTWARE-COMPANIES. WE KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO CODE GAMES AND
 IT'S REALLY LAME TO DAMAGE THIS WORK BY PIRATING IT.   ALL GUYS WHO ALWAYS
 SAY "THE GAMES ARE SOOOOOOO EXPENSIVE" ARE A BIT WRONG. WHY THAT? YOU
 JUST HAVE TO BUY ONE GOOD GAME A MONTH AND NOT ALL SHITTY STUFF THAT'S
 NOT WORTH THE DISK IT'S ON.   THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD GAMES THAT ARE
 WORTH BUYING (FOR EXAMPLE: FALCON, POPULOUS, XENON 2, DUNGEON MASTER,
 AND NEARLY EVERYTHING FROM MICROPROSE - I REALLY HOPE THE NEW PC-STUFF
 WILL BE CONVERTED TO THE ST).    WE DID A RADICAL CUT IN OUR LIFES AND
 STOPPED ALL PIRATING FROM ONE DAY TO THE OTHER.  JUST TRY IT!  PIRACY IS
 NOT GOOD FOR YOU! ALWAYS REMEMBER:  "A PROGRAM WORTH USING IS WORTH BUYING!"
       THAT'S ALL 4 2DAY! LET'S WRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZ!
