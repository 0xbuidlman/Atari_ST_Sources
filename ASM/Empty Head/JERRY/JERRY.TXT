Well it isn't really any version of our engine. Martin Hejral has done 
a lot of other things on other side of our engine (loading and saving 
in C and so on), but I don't have enough time and his permission to 
put it here, so perhaps it'll be next time.

Anyway this routine will work probably only on F030 computers and 
maybe on STE (not Mega), because in this working stadium it needs 
joyapad to switch off the program.

Lets name it Jerry v0.1 and now I can start to code newer and higher 
versions :)
