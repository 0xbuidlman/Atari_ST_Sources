; 	This source was programmed using Devpac 3.   
;	I don't think this source will assemble to well
;	with Turboass, but if you've been using that one
;       then this is a opportunity to change to somthing
;	powerful now ;-). Who needs a debugger anyway...
;	(Do some clean coding and you won't need it - 
;	Hi Innovator, Lucky, pun intended!... hehe ;-))) )

; 	This is the demo-OS used in Lostblubb, demonstrated
;	with the dba intro for easier understanding.
;	Don't find it disturbing if this intro isn't exactly
;	the release version, I believe the finished version
;	got lost somewhere. So if the dister at the end doesn't
;	appear, that's ok, it's not here... ;-)
;	Oh, and it's the wrong module in the dat file. Don't ask me
;	how it got in here, I included the right one for reference.
;	(The more I think of it, this seems to be an unfinished version
;	of the whole intro, but it doesn't matter for the subject at hand)
;	I understand that today with the existance of
;	accelerators and stuff the classic vbl-timer method
;	may not be the best. Nevertheless it should be easy
;	to modify this to a time-based timer. You can of
;	course modify this source as much as you like, just
;	refer to it in the credits. Don't forget to change 
;	the path names! And as always, the genius-parts were
;	done by us, but we were forced by aliens to do the 
;	lame rest ;-) .
;	
;	Cu Lazer, and watch for our stuff in the future, but
;	on other platforms...

; PS:
;
; To see how the effects are linked into this os, check out
; one of the parts of this intro. It is quite simple...
; Check out the mainfile first, then
; start with the 3d part for a non_vbl type task.
; The credits screen then shows a classic vbl type task.
; Also be sure to set the include paths of devpac!
; demo.s and startup.s are used in almost every screen.
; In the final version all files can be merged to one
; big file using the gfa-prog "onefile". In general, all precalcs
; are done with GFA, which is the most convenient way.
; Oh, and yes, main_xx.s in the folder main is the main file.
; Lost Blub was done with exactly the same os... 

We'd like to say respect to those who've made the scene worthwhile
with releases instead of talk. It is you who kept us motivated.
Regards to all of you out there, you know who you are
anyway... 

Not the end.
