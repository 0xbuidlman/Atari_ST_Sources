	Here's some source code courtesy of the BullFrog programming
team. (Flood, Populus, etc...) It's from a series in ST Format mag.
(UK) on assembly programming in games. You need DevPac to assemble
it. It's pretty well commented so you can learn quite a bit without
the articles. Try tweaking the equates (equ) at the top for
variations. Remove the semi-colon ';' from in front of 'rapid fire' to
turn it on. When I get time, (ha ha!), I'll try to sum up some points
in the series for you and U/L it all. Have Fun!
