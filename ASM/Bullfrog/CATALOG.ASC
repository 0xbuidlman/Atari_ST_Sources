BULLFROG is some source code courtesy of the BullFrog programming team.
(Flood, Populus, etc...) It's from a series in ST Format mag.  (UK) on
assembly programming in games. You need DevPac to assemble it. It's pretty
well commented so you can learn quite a bit without the article. In the
game you are a unicycle attacked by golf-holes.
