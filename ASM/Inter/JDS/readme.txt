Julian Dentro System

 by Inter Development
 Dec. 6th 2014

This is the demo framework used for
the Obnoxious demo by Inter.
The source code was already released
back in the '90 but wasn't spreaded
very often. This is a re-release of
this code and we hope you'll find
it interessting.

Stay Atari!!
