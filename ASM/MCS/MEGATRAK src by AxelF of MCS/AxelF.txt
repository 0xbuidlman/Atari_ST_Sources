4 years of work
for a buggy tracker
i was the first (i guess) to have coded a replay routine on STE then on Falcon

i had too much idea
and i was not a good coder (even if i liked that)

the Graoupmf tracker was my concurrent (near the end) and the coder was good and fast

then ATARI gave up the falcon for the jag
then ATARI closed, i was disgusted

i gave up atari and the programmation in 1996
the pc was good to play, not to code


what if atari never closed....  i had idea for 3 games on Falcon.....
