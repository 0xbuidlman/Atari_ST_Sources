MEGATRACKER 0.97á                           September, 8th 1995

Now all effects (in the doc) are implemented.
(Almost 40 effects and 2 effects per voice are possible : use the volume
 column)

Graphics are a little bit modified to see the maximum informations when
editing.

Can now play   8/16 bits  Mono/stereo samples, BUT cannot load them yet.

Just convert XM and ULT Modules with the Simplet's Module Converter
(These module use 16 bits samples)

The MGT files generated can be replay with the Megatracker and are in
version 1.1

The Version 1.0 : will load these kind of samples, will optimise the
duplicated tracks (Use the Module Converter to optimize) , and more..
***************************************************************************
MEGATRACKER 0.95á                                July, 8th 1995

I have left the MGT for 2 Months (Because of an other job taking too much
time). But now I work seriously on it and on the Jaguar.

The Design have been modified for musicians (lesser voices displayed on the
screen, but they are bigger).

The number (1-2-3-4-5), upon the # of the tracks of each voices, are the
# of the channel for this voices. The Graphx have not been finished,
there will be 2 arrows on the right side of these # to scroll the voices
(but it's active yet)

The Mask selector (for the file selector) is changed. When Module is active
the selector will show all kind of module recognized by the MGT.
(Now you don't have to rename .669 into .mod)

When saving, type just the 8 characters of the filename. Extension will be
added (MGT if module, MGS if sample)

I keep the older MGT version to listen the modules.

MEGATRACKER 0.942á                               March, 25th 1995

New : Now 8 octaves, from 0 to 7 (S3M 100% compatible)
                                 (3-4-5 = Amiga Octave)
                                 
      Volume Column changed:  
      	$00 to $40 => $10 to $50   ($10 means Note Cut)
      	$01 = Takes the default volume of the Sample
        $51 to $5F Volume Slide Down  Etc...
        
      Default Volume of the sample is now from $000 to $400
                                   (instead of $00  to $40)
                                   
      So the Set Volume Function $C is from    $000 to $400
      All Volume slides are not modified (Takes the value of the parameter
                                          and multiply it by 16)
                                          
      (New Vol Slide functions will be added (Extra Fine Vol Slide)
      
      One of the two bugs in the S3M translation fixed
***************************************************************************
MEGATRACKER 0.941á                               Feburary, 14th 1995

Now reading the 669 format (Bliss  will be happy)
hem! just rename the .669 to .MOD

Loop options (Except the Buffer Len) are now activated
You can change the Base Frequency of the Sample (from 1500 to 50033 Hz)

The volume column is also used for effects :
        Value $00 to $40 ARE the volume ($00 means nothing, not Note Cut)
              $41 to $4F Volume Slide Down
              $51 to $5F Volume Slide Up    Etc...

All Module are entirely converted to my format :
	Set Speed / Tempo on the same $F function 
	ex: $F xxyy   (xx is the Tempo, yy is the Speed)
	
	Vol slide is now extended to 255 value (instead of 15)
	ex: $A xxyy  (xx will up the vol and yy will down the vol)
	
	Set Vol is converted to the volume column, except for the
	0 value (still $C 0000 ,  note off)

	etc... (Look at my new format, if you have it)
	
The Save option is now enabled (Not for this á version)

Hi to MacJee (DIGITAL TRACKER). Its interface is more and more impressive
and beautiful, but I think my format is a little bit better (I hope,
because I don't want to have worked during 4 years to produce a shit...)

For users : Write me your criticism (Except about MY awful interface I will
change this later...)


So, go on:

Bugs of RETRIG NOTE and PORTAMENTOES removed (Shame on me)

Name of samples and songs are 32 char

Now you can see LOOP START, LOOP END, LOOP BUFFER LEN (soon updatable).

What is the LOOP BUFFER LEN? It's for programmers : When you don't want
to test, in your replay routs, the end of the loop every time (slowing
your CPU), an optimisation consist of removing these tests and to place
a little buffer, just after the LOOP END address, containing the sheet of
sample corresponding to the very first bytes of the LOOP START.
In the future MGT module format (ready but not released yet) this buffer
will not be saved, just the value of each buffer len needed for each sample
(depending on the highest periode reached by each sample, the tempo, the
base (frq) of the sample, the frequency of the replay rout).
If this value is too small => at a high frequency you will listen some
scratching sounds from time to time (at the end of the loop)
(Very awful with chip music).
If this value is too high => it will only takes too much memory but the
sound will be OK. So I will do a rout that will determine the correct
value. (I will also do a rout that suppress the redunding tracks).


NOTE : All value are displayed in HEX.
       Except : LEN of sample
                LOOP START
                LOOP END
                LEN BUFFER LOOP                 (in DEC)


Now you can use CLR options (press CONTROL KEY while clicking)
CLR ALL must be use with the other options :

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLR MUS     : Reset the restart (0), the initial tempo ($7D) and speed (6),
	      the volume for each voice, the name and the sequence 
	      (all to 0) of its patterns.
              This clear the current musique only
CLR ALL MUS : Reset the same things for ALL music
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLR POS     : Reset (to 0) the sequence of the current music
CLR ALL POS : Reset the sequence of ALL music in memory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLR PTN     : Set to 0 the current pattern (leave the LEN PTN as the same)
              Warning : A pattern can be use by other music
CLR ALL PTN : Reset ALL the patterns in memory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLR TRK     : Set to 0 each row of the CURRENT track (where is the cursor)
              (leave the LEN TRK as the same)
CLR ALL TRK : (guess)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLR SPL     : Erase the current sample of the memory
CLR ALL SPL : (guess)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now you can decrease the number of MUS, POS, PTN, TRK in the memory by
clicking with the left button AND the CONTROL KEY
Warning : It suppress the lasts (MUS, POS, PTN, TRK)

Remember : 'MAX values' means that the numbers are from 0 to MAX-1
	   Ex : If there are 81 TRK, their numbers are from 0 to 80

I would like to say that I'm working on the replay rout for JAGUAR.

MEGATRACKER 0.932á                                  september, 25th 1994

Bug of STOP button fixed (thanks to BLISS)

Now you can choose the tracks (for each voice)

Some minor details implemented, as :
 - The Shift keys are now active, try them with Arrows
   Try also them with the Insert Key (Insert a blank line in current track)
                and the Clr-Home Key (Delete a line in current Track)

 - You can now press the mouse buttons for a long time
   Repetitions have been implemented (useful to scroll the directory)
 
 - Try the F8 key (VGA mode only)
 
 - SpaceBar = Play Song On/Off
 
 - BackSpace = Blank the current line of the current track
              (Pointed by the cursor)

Some little shitty bugs removed

(I swear the next time it will be the version 0.94á. The Version 1.0
will be registerable  (soon))
***************************************************************************
MEGATRACKER 0.931á                                   august, 18th 1994

This is exactly the same version than 0.93á  BUT with many bugs fixed:
(I hope)

Loading correct
No more ghosts rows
EDIT function correct
scrolling track correct
MTM loop correct (MTM module TIMEDRIF.MTM now correct it was the only one
                  I found with this bug)
Font now 8*8 (instead of 8*7, I used it on the STE to have more cpu time.
              Bugging the minus letters)


Hem... I have not yet coded the 669 format to my new format (with track)
but I will do it (I swear).
***************************************************************************
MEGATRACKER 0.93á                                    august,  8th 1994

Great improvement : Now each patterns are no rows nor columns any longer.
I use a new system (new for soundtracker not for sequencer) :  the TRACKS
Now patterns are just : 
          len (# of rows) of pattern + pointers (Voice -> Track).
          
Look at the difference between a MOD loaded and a MTM loaded.
The first one has his tracks consecutives, not the second one.
This way allow to save much of memory wasted as before.

Now you can chose the max number of Positions (len of a sequence), Patterns
and tracks up to 65535 (eheh). Hem! in fact, in this version you can only
increase this number, decrease not yet implemented (I'm working on it with
suppession of selected track (not the last, as decreasing), and the
insertion (not adding to the end).
You cannot choose your track yet.

WARNING : The display is now hexa.

New : The parameters are on 2 bytes (MOD : 1 byte) allowing to implement
better effect (volume from 0 to 255 instead of 64 for both left and right
at the same time, arpeggio on 5 periods instead of 3, ...)

New function: $22 SET STEREO  param: xxyy  (xx:left volume yy:right vol)
BUT I have not yet implemented the new volume management (0 ->255)
still 64... (I'm working on it)

The bug of the bad loop in S3M format if fixed
Some minor bugs are fixed (I now there are still left)

Now I'm working on the 0.94 with :
Supp, Insert : pos,patt,track
modification of a len of track (<> len of the patt)
 If len track = len patt  => no prbm
 If len track > len patt  => the end of the patt has priority
                             the rows left of the track will not be played
 If len track < len patt  => nothing will be played at the end of track

Block management

***************************************************************************
MEGATRACKER 0.92á                                    june, 24th 1994

Now can hear S3M mod format, not 100% correct because of 2 new effects
(tremor and retrig+volumeslide), and strange loop samples (2ND_PM.S3M).
If you think that a sample should not loop, then choose it
(using 'insert' and 'clr' keys), then press F6 to disable loop mode.

Some minor bugs removed
***************************************************************************
And now this is the MEGATRACKER 0.91á                june, 4th  1994

Tempo is now implemented (by Simplet (Abstract))

Using Host Interrupts for both 68030 and DSP, useful for leaving free
more DSP memory (I compute 1 channel at time), so you can have others
routs in it.

Sample base frequency is now from 8400 to 49170

The 6 octaves are enabled (Keyboard : low, med , high, very high)
WARNING : the higher the frequency is, the more 68030 time you take

Panning is now implemented (From PC version : MTM and S3M)
It's the $E8 function ($18 here)
Parameter is from 0 to $f (from left to right)

And soon : A mega .MOD format
           New panning management : 
           both sides (left and right) will be independant
***************************************************************************
So here is the MEGATRACKER 0.9á                      may, 23th 1994

by Axel Follet (MCS) for the Code
   Simplet (Abstract) for the DSP rout
   Alf (?) for the GRFX
   
Featuring 32 channels 8 bits (interpolated to 16 bits)
Allowing MOD format, 8CHN, CD81, FLT8, 669(rename them to .mod), MAD, MTM
         (also Oktalyser (amiga) but not really correct)
and soon S3M (because I receive the official format yesterday)

REMEMBER to modify a value (as volume, position, pattern ...)
click on it with the left button to increase (by 1, 10 or 100) and
the right one to decrease (same)

To load a mod click on it then click on LOAD (SAVE is disabled)
(You can pack with the ATOMIK 3.5)
For Loading a sample the MEGATRAK will find the first free place.

To go up on directories click on the smiley

Volume is modified by the number of active voices (you can modify it
yourself but the sound can become trashy)

Frequency is not useful with the DSP version (Old 68030 version used it)

To change selected drive, click on it then click on DRIVE to validate
(WARNING I've got many trouble with A and B floppy but as everybody have
 an Hard Drive ...)

KEYBOARD : if you choose PIANO : Standard soundtracker piano keyboard
           OCTAVE is LOW, MED or HIGH  because AMIGA format has 3 octaves
           (from A-1 to G-3)
           mine has 6 octaves (from A-0 to G-5) BUT in this demo version
           it is not correctly implemented (bugs with MTM format)
           
           if you choose DRUM : The keyboard will be a DrumKit (try all keys)
           and as you can have 256 samples and the keyboard has only 64 keys
           POSITION allow you to reach all samples ('A' key is the first spl)
           
And in SAMPLE you can choose the correct FRQ. command and parameter for a
sample (useful for DRUMKIT).
Volume and fine tune are used both by PIANO and DRUM.

MONO/STEREO are not implemented in this version
SIGNED allow to convert SIGNED/UNSIGNED sample
CODED ON (8 / 16) BITS (no comment)
REDUCED TO  (15-14 / 7-6) BITS is not useful with the DSP version
(it was for the 68030 version)

MEGATRACK allows several MUSIC in 1 module (a music is a succession of
patterns)

NOTE OPTION is not yet implemented

Clear     SAMPLE,PATTERN or MUSIC (just erase current)
Clear ALL SAMPLE,PATTERN or MUSIC (erase all)
           
VOICES :    a 'X' : voice is a music    channel
 (and/or)   a 'F' : voice is a sound FX channel  (for the replay rout)
            a 'B' : for block mode (not implemented in this beta version)
                    (block will be copied,cut,pasted or deleted)
                    
Block mode is not implemented here

In sample, loop is not modifiable yet
 
Instead of the AMIGA format, in pattern, volume is independant
a row is coded : 1 byte for the note
                 1 byte for the instrument
                 1 byte for the command
                 1 byte for the parameter
                 1 byte for the volume    (equivalent to 'C' command)
                                          (but 'C' has priority)

With this DSP version I have not implemented the TEMPO, and you can count
1% to 1,5% of 68030 time taken by voice (for the replay rout only because
all voices are actives in the editor, but not necessairly listenable)

The samples have no lenght limit

Press : 'HELP' to watch cpu time taken
        'UNDO' to modifie the stereo    (LLRR to LRLR) due to AMIGA
                                                       non standard stereo
        'INS' and 'CLR' : change the number of the current sample (PIANO mode)
                          same effect by clicking
        'ESC' to stop listening

I include all Protracker effects (except funk, filter and panning (PC) )
The $Exy commands (protracker) are implemented in $1x yy (MGT)
and I will implemente new S3M effects
        
Well I think that's all for this moment.

I began to code this in november 1990 for my STE (11 voices) and little
by little (when I had time) I ameliorate it, and it will be in constant
evolution.
