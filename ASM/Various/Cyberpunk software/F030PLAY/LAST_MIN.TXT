
Last minute note.....

Testing have resulted in a brain fuck up inside my head. There
is a very strange bug in this version and I have no idea of
might occur it. I'll explain and then you'll know why 'some'
modules won't work.

2 modules of 19 tested wouldn't work. I packed them, first with
Atomik Packer but it was no difference and then with Ice Packer
and then suddenly one of them did work. As I said before I have
no idea of what's wrong but it sure is wierd. I haven't got the
other one to work.

Until next version I'll try to find, catch and terminate this
focking bug and maybe also add a nice little feature I'm thinking
of. However, 2 of 19..... I guess you can live with that for
a week or two.....
