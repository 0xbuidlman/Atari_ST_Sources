
This ARC file contains the next files:

- DESKTOP1.PRG
- DESKTOP2.PRG
- DESKTOP1.ACC
- DESKTOP2.ACC
- DESKTOP3.ACC
- DESKTOP.TXT   (This text)

The primary concern of all these programs/accesorys is to  change 
the  desktop gray in the monochrome high-resolution with a  Degas 
(Elite) file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

-  DESKTOP1.PRG is the simplest of them all:  put it in the  AUTO 
folder  of your boot device and put DESKTOP.PI3 in the same  AUTO
folder or in the root directory.  This picture will be loaded and 
will appear every time the desktop has to be (re)drawn.  If  this 
picture does not exist an error message wil be given (***  Error: 
DESKTOP.PI3 ??  ***).  If the picture is not 32034 bytes or  more 
long  it will be loaded,  but a warning will be  given  (Warning: 
DESKTOP.PI3<32000).

(Project version 1.0).

This  version has no bugs!  The program is as short  as  possible 
(since files are written to disk in clusters of 1024 bytes,  pro-
gram  lengths  should be just under a 1024 boundary.  It  has  no 
advantages  to make a file of just 120 bytes,  because  it  still 
needs 2 sectors on disk!!).

- DESKTOP1.ACC is the simplest accessory: it loads DESKTOP.PI3 or 
DESKTOP.PC3 (the Degas form of compression) from the root  direc-
tory.  After the start-up it is possible to reload a Degas  file: 
click   on the 'Desktop Picture' menu at the   accessories,   and  
an  alertbox  will  ask  you whether  you  want  a  new  picture,  
(de)select  the old gray background or do  nothing.  Clicking  on 
'New'  displays the  fileselectbox with all the P?3 files on  the 
device  and  the name of the picture in the background memory  at 
this moment. Just try it out ...

(Project version 2.01).

This version has no problems when no other GEM vector programs or 
accessories are used.  With the 'Show' option of the desktop or a 
TOS or TTP program the original GEM vector is reinstalled by  the 
system,  so this accessory then reinstalls its own  vector.  When 
other GEM vector programs are used,  the vectors get mixed up and 
your computer will at least bomb. In this cases you can use

- DESKTOP2.ACC,  which is similar to DESKTOP1.ACC, except for the 
GEM  vector reinstallment.  When you have troubles using  one  of 
them, you should be able to use the other.

(Project number 2.02).

I  have troubles with GEMKEY and DESKTOP when they are booted  in 
the reverse order (!),  so I'm using this version. When GEMKEY is 
booted before DESKTOP the 2.01 version should be used (you should 
be able to see why now ...).

-  DESKTOP2.PRG is an advanced version of 1.0:  it does the  same 
and something extra. Since the 1.0 version has no bugs (but it is 
not possible to reload a picture) it should be able to obtain the 
picture  adress from the AUTO program and use this in  an  acces-
sory!  That  is exactly what DESKTOP2 does:  when you're  calling 
vs_clip(handle,-1,clip) with  clip[0]=0,  clip[1]=0,  clip[2]=639 
and clip[3]=399,  and the interior and style are set to 2 and  4, 
you   obtain   the picture adress in  *(long   *)(intout+4).   To  
control  whether  DESKTOP2  has been  installed  *(long  *)intout  
contains 'N_DP' ($4e5f4450) when the picture adress is valid or a 
0  when it  is  not.  More  information in the sources  of  these 
programs which are in another ARC file.

(project number (1.1).

This program has no bugs.  The intout array normally returns  no-
thing when vs_clip() is called.  If DESKTOP2.PRG is not resident, 
the  normal  version of vs_clip(handle,1,clip)  is  carried  out, 
which has no negative effects, because it clips the output to the 
whole screen!  When you're using BIGSCRN or similar programs  you 
should call vs_clip again with the actual screen sizes.

- DESKTOP3.ACC is the accessory that uses DESKTOP2.PRG.  The pic-
ture adress is asked by the accessory and given by the AUTO  pro-
gram.  It is now possible to reload a picture at this adress with 
this accessory.

(project number 2.03).

This accessory does not (re)install its own GEM vector,  so there 
should not be any any errors with other programs/accessories.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

When  all  you want is a PI3 file as background  you  should  use 
version 1.0.  If you want to be able to change the  picture,  and 
don't  use any (other) fancy accessories you should  use  version 
2.01.  If that does not work you should try 2.02.  If you want to 
be  able  to  change  the desktop  picture  even  from  your  own 
application you should use the combination of 1.1 and  2.03.  How 
this  can  be done is mentioned in principle.  As  you  can  see: 
there's  a  solution to every problem  (well,  every  ...:  these 
programs  do  all  kind  of  weird  things  when  used  on  other 
resolutions than high!).

The  sources  of these programs are in another  ARC  file.  These 
sources and the programs in this ARC file are all Public  Domain, 
which means that they should not be sold,  but copied only. It is 
not more then logical that the name of the author is mentioned in 
programs using this source(s)...
