		QPAC v3.2 by John M Phillips (C) 1990

			   DOCUMENTATION
			   -------------

QPAC v3.2 is the latest version of the fastest file packer on the ST.

Updates since v2 :

    -	the packer now pre-scans the source file for even faster packing
    -	you can now pack executables (i.e. .TOS/.PRG/.TTP files) and save
	them with the unpacker tagged on the front with an optional
	flashing border whilst unpacking
    -	packed files retain compatibility with the old QPAC2 unpacker

PACKER
------

Usage:	1) Click on QPAC3.TTP
	2) Enter source file name (data or executable)
	3) When the file has been packed (SPACE aborts) you can then
	   enter/edit the destination filename. If the source file
	   was executable you can select to save it either as raw data
	   or with an executable header tagged on the front to unpack.

NOTE:	Works best in medium resolution 'cos I still haven't put in the
	bar-graphs for low-res or mono.

UNPACKER
--------

QUNPACK.S is the source code for the file unpacker which can be 'included'
into any program.

The source consists of a single routine 'unpack_file'.

Call it with :
	A0 = address of packed file
	A1 = address to store unpacked file
On exit D0 = error code (0=ok,1..3=various errors)
	A0/A1 = start and end addresses of the unpacked file
