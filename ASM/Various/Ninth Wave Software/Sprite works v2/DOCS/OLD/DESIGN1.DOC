
                    Non-scrolling Map Designer
                    --------------------------


This  program is used to design screens with 16x16 pixel  sprites. 
The example game SLUG BLAST shows the map printer in  action.  The 
map designer can handle 720 sprites and a playing area from 1x1 to 
20x12 squares.  Each location of the map uses one word (two bytes) 
which hold the sprite number and user flags.  You are allowed  six 
flags  which  are  the top six bits of the  word  (These  will  be 
explained later).

Main menu
---------

To  use  the map designer first set your map area  with  the  'set 
screen' command.  This will allow you to change the size from  1x1 
to 20x12 squares which represent 16x16 - 320x192 pixels.

Once  the  size  is set you can load in  your  map  graphics.  The 
graphics must be arranged from left to right, top to bottom within 
16x16 pixel boundaries.  Unlike the SPRITE WORKS sprites these  do 
not need masks. Make sure that you do not have any empty locations 
between  the  sprites.  The reason for this is  that  the  program 
automatically  checks each location to see whether there  are  any 
graphics in them and stores them in memory.  The map graphics must 
be  in  Degas Elite PC1 format and must be loaded in  sequence  to 
screens  1,2 and 3 on the main menu.  Graphics will only  take  up 
more than one screen if the previous screen is COMPLETELY full  of 
16x16 sprites.

*******************************************************************
* Load in the file SLUG.MAP with 'load map' and SLUG_MAP.PC1 with *
* 'load screen 1'. This will provide an example to be used as     *  
* reference.                                                      *
*******************************************************************

After  loading  a  screen the number of sprites  counted  will  be 
displayed on the main menu. 

To select a screen to edit,  select the arrows on the edit control 
or  select the area between the arrows to enter the screen  number 
manually. Select 'edit screen' to change to the screen editor.

The number of screens currently designed is also shown on the main 
menu. When you select 'new screen' you will be taken to the screen 
editor and the number of screens is increased.

The flags are used to give attributes to each map location. In the 
example you can see that two flags are used,  SOLID and SEMI SOLID 
which  represent  the  11th and 12th bits  of  the  word  location 
respectively.  The  game  uses these bits to see whether  you  are 
standing on a solid or semi solid location,  or whether you hit  a 
solid while walking.  In this example the word location is used as 
follows.

     Bit  15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1 0
                      |  |  |                         |
                     /   \   \---- Sprite Number ----/
                   /       \
         SEMI SOLID         SOLID

Run the file PRINTMAP.GFA to understand this slightly better.

After  designing your screens,  use 'save map' and 'save  gfx'  to 
save the map data and the map graphics.

At the bottom of the menu the total memory is shown.  This is  how 
much memory is used by the map data AND the map graphics.

Screen Editor
-------------

At the bottom of the screen editor the flag,  screen number,  x, y 
and sprite number are shown.  While the cursor is above the bottom 
menu  a box shows your position.  When you  select the left  mouse 
button  the current sprite number is placed at that  location.  To 
change the sprite press the right mouse button. This will bring up 
the  map graphics so that you change then select your sprite  with 
the left mouse button.  You can also select a block of sprites  by 
increasing  the height and width of the box with the cursor  keys. 
By pressing keys 1-3 you can change the screen which the  graphics 
were loaded into.

When you have drawn your screen you will want to set the flags. To  
do  this you must select which flag you require by  selecting  the 
appropriate  arrow.  Select  the area between the arrows  and  the 
screen will be redrawn with boxes corresponding to whether the map 
location  has  had the flag set or reset.  Draw on the  screen  to 
set/reset  the map locations then press the right mouse button  to 
exit. See the example map to see the solid and semi-solid flags.

You  can scroll through the screens that you've designed by  using 
the left and right cursor keys.

When you have designed your screen and set the appropriate  flags, 
exit to the main menu and save your map data.

Map format
----------

Each screen takes up 2*width*height bytes. In the example file the 
screen size is 20x12 which means that it uses 480 bytes a screen.

The  first two words of the map file contain the width and  height 
of the screen.

The  next 48 bytes contain the flag names which are only  used  by 
the map designer for reference.

Each screen is then sequentially stored.

     Offset

       0       Width
       2       Height
       4       Six flag names
       52+     Screens

When printing the map using the command print_map (see MANUAL.DOC) 
you  supply the address of the map data and the command  will  get 
the width and height and skip over the 48 byte flag names
