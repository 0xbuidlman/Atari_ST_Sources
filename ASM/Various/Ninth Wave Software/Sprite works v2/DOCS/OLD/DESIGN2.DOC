
                    The Ultimate Map Designer
                    -------------------------

                Vertical and Multi-Directional Maps
                -----------------------------------


The second design program is used to design scrolling  maps,  both 
vertical  scrolling and muti-directional scrolling.  As  with  the 
first map designer,  the map is built up from 16x16 pixel sprites. 
Any  size  map  can  be created as large  as  memory  may  permit, 
although the minimum height is 12 blocks. Each location of the map 
uses  one  long  word (four bytes) which holds a  pointer  to  the 
sprite  to be printed and not a sprite number as was the  case  in 
the first map designer.  Also there are no flags contained  within 
the  map  data,  if flags are required then they  can  be  created 
within this map designer then loaded separately.  If you use flags 
then  it will create a template file with each map location  using 
one byte,  thus allowing 8 flag bits.  If you are using a vertical 
type map then each 16x16 sprite block will use 128 bytes,  but  if 
you  are  designing a multi-directional map then each  block  will 
take  up  a whopping 896 bytes.  This is due to  pre-shifting  the 
graphics  which  need to be stored rotated 0,4,8  and  12  pixels. 
Vertical  maps  can have up to 720 sprites  but  multi-directional 
maps are limited to 480 sprites,  but as this will take up 430K it 
is unlikely that they will all be used !

Main menu
---------

The first step is to select the size of the map by selecting  'set 
size',  the  default size is 80x80 to give a large  square  multi-
directional type map.

The  map  graphics must then be loaded into screen  banks  1-3  by 
selecting  'load  screen 1-3'.  Remember that a vertical  map  can 
handle  three screenfuls of graphics but a  multi-directional  map 
can  handle only two.  Map graphics file must be stored  in  Degas 
Elite PC1 format.

Unlike  the first map designer the number of map sprites  must  be 
set manually.  Select 'set sprites' then move the mouse and select 
the lowest/rightmost sprite.  At the top left of the main menu the 
current width, height and number of sprites will be shown.

If flags are to be used then you can enter a flag name be clicking 
on  the corresponding bit in the flag window on the right side  on 
the main menu.

******************************************************************
* There are two example maps that can be loaded :                *
* Platform game, load PLATFORM.MAP with 'load map',		 *
* 	PLATFORM.FLG with 'load flags' and, SLUG_MAP.PC1 with	 *
*	'load screen 1.						 *		
* Racing game, load RACER.MAP, RACER.FLG, RACER.PC1              *
* All files can be found in the SOURCE folder                    *
******************************************************************

When  you have designed your map you must select  the  appropriate 
scroll type,  either vertical or 8-way (multi-directional) at  the 
top right of the main menu.  You can see the graphics size  change 
at the bottom of the screen when you select the type.

The  graphics  are saved with 'save gfx',  if  you  have  selected 
vertical  scroll type then the graphics will be  saved  instantly, 
but  if 8-way is selected then the graphics must  be  pre-shifted. 
If  this  is the case then a countdown will be  displayed  at  the 
bottom of the screen as the graphics are saved.  If you have quite 
a few sprites then it may take some time to save.

At  the bottom of the screen are the memory requirements  of  each 
file and of the files in total.  Take note of the total  size,  if 
you  are designing a multi-directional map on a half  meg  machine 
remember that you will need space to load GFA Basic !

Screen Editor
-------------

After selecting 'edit map' on the main menu you will be  presented 
with a small menu at the bottom of the screen,  similar to the one 
in the first map designer.  It displays the current flag, x, y and 
sprite  number.  While the cursor is above the bottom menu  a  box 
shows  your position and when in the bottom menu a cross  hair  is 
shown  which  allows you to select a flag or to exit to  the  main 
menu.  While  above the menu you can draw the current sprite  with 
the left mouse button or select a new sprite with the right  mouse 
button.

Selecting  a  new sprite takes you to a screen in  which  you  can 
scroll up and down all of the sprites with the mouse.  The size of 
the block can be altered with the cursor keys so that you can  cut 
out  a  large  block made up from a  number  of  smaller  sprites. 
Pressing any mouse button exits.

While  on the screen editor you can use the cursor keys to  scroll 
around the map if it is larger than the screen.

When you have drawn your map you may want to set the flags to give 
attributes  to the map locations.  To do this select the flag  you 
require  by selecting the appropriate arrow at the bottom left  of 
the screen. Then select the area between the arrows where the flag 
name is and the screen will change to the flag editor.

If  a flag is set then the corresponding map location will have  a 
box drawn around it. Simply draw the the mouse to set or reset the 
flags,  the draw mode will toggle when the first flag is selected. 
ie,  when you select an empty flag location the draw mode will set 
all other flags and selecting a set flag location first will reset 
the  draw  mode.  Select  the right mouse  button  when  you  have 
finished.

When  you  have completed designing your map and/or  flags  select 
exit  to get to the main menu and save the  map,  graphics  and/or 
flags.

Map format
----------

The map data is stored as follows:

     Offset

     0    Width
     2    Height
     4    Number of sprites
     6    Graphics size (Used by map printer commands)
     10+  Map data

Each map location uses 4 bytes.

The flag data has a 64 byte header, then each location uses one
byte and the total size of the flag file will be (width*height)+64.

Maps  can  be displayed using the commands v_mapper  for  vertical 
maps and mapper for multi-directional maps (see MANUAL.DOC).
