
Using Sprite Works Art Package
------------------------------

Throughout the program the left mouse button is commonly used to
select and the right button to exit or deselect.

Menu Move
---------

      At  the top left of the menu there is an icon which  can  be 
used to move the menu around the screen.  There is not alot of use 
for  this,  but if it wasn't there you'd be asking 'Why can't  you 
move the menu around ?'.

Information Bar
---------------

      By  selecting  the top of the menu where 'SPRITE  WORKS'  is 
written an information window is displayed.

Colour Select
-------------

      On  the  right  side of the main menu  are  the  16  colours 
available. Simply select which colour you want and a marker at the 
side of the colours will be displayed.

Screen Select & Copy
--------------------

      The  six workscreens are represented near the bottom of  the 
menu.  To select a new workscreen simply click on the  appropriate 
number.  To  copy from screen to screen you must press  the  mouse 
button  briefly on the source screen and drag the box over to  the 
destination screen. You can copy the screen, palette or both.

Block
-----

      Selecting block from the main menu will bring up a sub  menu 
of  various  functions.  The first function is to  toggle  whether 
block mode is on or off. If the block mode is on then the draw and 
fill functions on the main menu will be affected. Without bringing 
up the main menu the block mode can be toggled with the 'b' key.  

      Cut Box (or ESC key) and Cut Circle can be used to  copy  an 
area of screen into the cut buffer.

      Erase,  Solid,  X-Ray,  Mask and Inv Mask are used to define 
how  the  cut  buffer will be placed on the screen  when  draw  is 
selected  and block mode is on.  Erase will cause the block to  be 
placed  on screen as the background colour.  Solid will place  the 
block as the original block, while X-Ray will cause the background 
colour to be transparent.  Mask and Inv Mask are used for creating 
masks  for sprites.  The 'e' key can be used to cycle through  the 
different modes while drawing.

      Merge has now been added which ORs the block with the screen.
This is designed to allow selected bitplanes to be moved and merged
with the screen. Use below command to select planes.

     Planes will allow you to select any of the four bit planes of
the block that you wish to keep.  A sub menu will display the bit-
planes with a tick by them if they are to be kept. Press the right
mouse  button to  exit.  The sprite  will then  be stripped of the
unwanted planes but the mask remains unaltered.

       Stretch  allows  you to enlarge or  reduce  a  block.  When 
selected  you  will  be  presented with  a  new  screen  with  the 
current width and height and the original width and height of  the 
block displayed.  Use the mouse to drag the block into a new shape 
and select when you wish to change the size. Hold down the altern-
ate  button to  give a  proportional  size of the  original block.
Press right mouse button to exit.

       Rotate allows you to rotate a block 0-359 degrees and as an 
added bonus you can also enlarge and reduce the block proportionally.
Move the mouse around the screen to get the desired angle and press
'-' or '+' on the main keyboard to alter the size. Press right mouse
button to exit. If you are rotating a sprite you will probably want
to keep the original width and height. If this is the case then hold
down the ALTERNATE button when you press the right mouse button, this
will keep the sprite correctly centered.

     Recolour will try to redraw the block with the current palette.
This is used when transfering a block from one screen to another which
has a different palette.

Draw
----

      If block mode is off a cross-hair will be displayed and  you 
can draw in the selected colour. In block mode the cross-hair will 
be replaced by the current block in the cut buffer. To toggle edge 
clipping press the 'TAB' key. Also while in block mode you can flip 
the block horizontally and vertically by the 'h' and 'v' keys 
respectively.

Spline
------

      The spline is actually a four point Bezier curve. You must 
select four control points, the curve will be drawn between the first
and last points with the second and third points acting as control
points. When you have selected all four points the curve will be
displayed but it will not be stored on the current screen until the
right mouse button is pressed. At this point you can move any of the
points by selecting a control point and while keeping the mouse
depressed, drag the control points to move the curve into the desired
position.

Line
----

      To draw a line, select the first point and drag the line to 
the end position and release the mouse button.

Circle
------

       Select the centre and drag the circle to the correct size. 
The default of this function is to actually draw an ellipse, 
should you want a perfect circle, keep the 'ALT' key depressed.

Disc
----

       Same as CIRCLE except that it is solid.

Frame
-----

       Select the first corner and drag the box to the required 
size.

Box
---

      As FRAME except that it is solid.

Fill
----

       Simply select the x/y coordinate to fill and the current 
fill pattern at bottom left of main menu will be used. To change 
the fill pattern select the bottom left window and a sub menu of 
fill patterns is displayed. The first two lines are general fill 
patterns, the third line of patterns are for reference grids and 
the bottom two lines are 16 colour fills which are not affected by 
the current select colour.

      If the block mode is on then the current block will be used 
as the fill pattern.

Poly
----

      To draw a polygon, select the points of the polygon and then 
press the right mouse button (a line is automatically drawn from 
the last to first point). You can now move points of the polygon 
by dragging the control points which have small boxes around them. 
When you are satisfied with the polygon simply press the right 
mouse button again. The default is to draw the polygon as a series 
of lines, but if you want a solid polygon then press the 'SHIFT' 
key to toggle the fill. If you are drawing a large solid polygon 
the program  will slow down considerably, so turn the fill off 
until the points are in the correct place then turn the fill on 
again before pressing the right mouse button.

Brush
-----

      This function had to be written slightly different from the 
others because it had to run very fast. Because of this you cannot 
zoom in AS you draw, but have to release the mouse button before 
you zoom in with the 'z' key.

      The current brush is shown above the text window on the main 
menu. To select a new brush, select this window and choose a new 
brush.

Text
----

      To alter text size select the appropriate direction from the 
text window at the bottom right. While text is being entered you 
can move the text around with the mouse and delete any characters 
with the 'backspace' key. Obviously you cannot enter zoom mode 
('z' key) as it will be interpreted as a 'z' character.

      You can now alter the text attributes and the fonts (if GDOS
is installed) by selected the bottom right text window. If you do
not have GDOS there are PD equivalents with hundreds of fonts
available, up to 11 fonts can be loaded.

Sprite
------

      Used for saving sprite data. Select the sprite width and 
height, then the first and last sprite. The amount of memory that 
the sprites use is displayed on the left. Sprites are taken from 
the current screen, and only one screen may be used. If your sprites
cover a number of screens then you must brake them down into a number
of files.

      Make sure that you have created a mask underneath each of the
sprites.

Animate
-------

      This produces a sub menu of the following functions; 
animate, joystick, mouse, sequence, reverse, start, end, delay, 
screen, width and height.

      Animate is used to start animation of the current sequence 
on the current screen. If mouse is select then the animation is 
continous and you can move the sprite around with the mouse, 
terminating with a mouse click. If joystick is selected then the 
animation is only updated when the joystick is moved and the 
sprite is moved in the appropriate direction and termination is 
with the fire button.

      To set up a sequence you MUST have a start, end, screen and 
height set. First set the width of either 16 or 32 pixels. Then 
select height and a grid will appear. Move the mouse up and down 
so that the grid matches the height of the sprites (not including 
the mask). Now select start and end and move the surrounding box 
onto the corresponding start and end sprites. Make sure that the 
screen value is the same as the sprite screen number and then set 
the delay time (which is in 50th of a second steps, a value of 
around 3-4 should be fine). When you animate, the sprites will
appear on your current workscreen which makes it ideal for mapping 
sprites onto a screen from your game. To make a number of different
sprite animations simply select a new sequence, up to a maximum of
99 can be created.

      Sprites MUST have a mask, which is made by cutting out the 
sprites and selecting MASK mode from the block menu or by pressing 
the 'e' key until the correct mode is found. Place the mask directly
underneath the sprites so make sure that your sprites are seperated
vertically by twice the sprites height (see example file DEMO.PC1).

Save
----

     Seven different formats can be saved; Neochrome (NEO), Degas
(PI1), Degas Elite (PC1), Image (IMG), Interchange Format (IFF),
Palette data (PAL) and also Sprite Animation Files (SAF). From the
save menu you can also delete a file and format a disk.

	 The IMG format simply saves the 32000 bytes of screen data and
is not the IMG format that some may be familiar with.

     The PAL file is used to include palettes into your own programs.
Simply load the palette into an INLINE statement and use XBIOS to set
the palette, eg
          
          INLINE palette%,32       <- load your palette file here
          ~XBIOS(6,L:palette%)     ! Set the palette

     The SAF file contains all the data entered on the animation menu.
It holds 99 records of 7 bytes and is used only by Sprite Works for
animation purposes.

Load
----

     Seven different formats can be loaded into Sprite Works; 
NEO, PI1, PC1, IFF, PAL , SAF and Animaster Sprite Bank (ASB). A 
note about  ASB files is that it can only fit sprites onto one 
screen and will chop off the rest if there are too many.

     NOTE:  The IFF loader isn't terribly robust, but it will load 
files from Deluxe Paint.

Snap
----

      When in block mode the 16 and 32 pixel snaps come in very 
handy. Snap is used to move the cursor to the nearest x/y  coor-
dinate that is divisable by the snap value. Note, the edge clipping
does not operate while snap is activated. 

Palette
-------

      This function is used to change any colour of the palette. 
The sub menu shows 3 sliders, 16 colours and a default and preset 
settings. The sliders represent the red, green and blue components 
of the current colour, select the up or down arrows to change the 
values. Default is used to change the colours back to their original
values and the preset values are used to substitute palettes which
have already been created. Once you exit the palette menu the default
palette becomes the current palette. You can copy from one colour
to another by dragging the required colour.

      By double clicking on a colour you can bring up a 512 colour
picker. Press left mouse button to select colour or right button
to cancel.

FX
--

     A couple of miscellaneous routines are placed on this menu.

SORT will rearrange the palette so that the colours are in order 
of contrast. It takes a second or two as the bitplanes are 
reconfigured.

BLACK/WHITE will change the palette into black and white shades 
which will have the equivalent contrast of the original colours.

VIEW BITPLANES will display a tiny menu at the bottom of the
screen which allows you to select which bitplanes are visable.
This does not affect the actual image, only the display.

Detail Zoom
-----------

      For sprite design this will be the most commonly used 
feature. Simply press the F-key corresponding to your desired 
magnification (F1=x3 to F6=x8). After selecting the window position
you will be displayed the the actual size portion of screen on the
left and the magnified part of the screen on the right. You can
select the pen colour from the right side of the screen or by
pressing the right mouse button while on the magnified screen.
Along the top right of the screen you can scroll the window by
selecting the appropriate arrow, or you can use the cursor keys.
In the right corner is a toggle for the grid which is overlaid on
the magnified screen.

      By pressing the SHIFT key while selecting a pixel on the 
magnified screen you can fill the portion of screen in the current 
pen colour. To exit the zoom move the cursor to the left side of 
the screen and press the right mouse button twice.

Real Time Zoom
--------------

      Another useful feature of Sprite Works is that you can at 
ANY time magnify the screen by a factor of 4. This allows you to 
work in greater detail for cutting blocks, drawing lines, circles, 
etc. To toggle the real time zoom use the 'z' key. While in zoom 
mode you can also scroll around by using the cursor keys.

Keyboard Controls
-----------------

F1-F6     Detail zoom mode
ESC       Cut a block
1-6       Select current screen
UNDO      Undo last command

Additions to version 1.1
------------------------

The resize option now has proportional resizing by holding down
the alternate button.

A correction in the cut block function means that a block will
appear in the same place it was cut out. Previously the block
would be shifted back and up by one pixel.

The program now loads in medium resolution although the GEM
drawing functions will not draw in colours 4-15. These include
draw, circle, disc, box, frame and poly. Fill, brush and detail
zoom colours are unaffected.

On the palette menu you can now copy from one colour to another
by dragging from one box to another.

Additions to version 1.2
------------------------

A bug in 1.1 meant that the first couple of colours were corrupted
when the picture was saved ... whoops. Now fixed.

The palette now has a 512 colour picker, and the copy colour routine
was rewritten.

GDOS fonts and selectable attributes have now been added.

Selectable bitplanes for screen and block and a merge mode for the
block function have been added. Useful for some, meaningless to
others !!!

When you rotate an object you can keep the original dimensions by
holding down ALT when you exit the rotater.

Loading and saving IMG files.

Automatic file extensions, avoids you having to re-type the file type
extension when you save a file.

Thats it ....
