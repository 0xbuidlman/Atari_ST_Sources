In this AUTO folder, you will find: 

STARTGEM.PRG a well known PD utility
which enables ANY program to auto-boot
It needs an ascii file 'STARTGEM.INF'
on the root directory, specifying the
file to auto-boot.

If 'STARTGEM.INF' is missing, or file
specified cannot be found, the program
will merely abort.


If you want to try Robin Edwards'
Accessory Selector, you should put it
in this folder, with the accessories
on the ROOT directory.
