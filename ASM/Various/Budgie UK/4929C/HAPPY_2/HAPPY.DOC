HAPPY FACE 2 by Robin Edwards
---------------------------

Happy Face 2  is a cute virus detector/
protector comparable in some ways to
Budgie's own GUARDIAN, the virus
early warning system.

The theory is to write a greeting code
such as HAPPY FACE or GUARDIAN on the
boot sector.

Each time you boot the disk, 
the greeting will appear. 
What could be more simple!

If the greeting fails to appear,
an uninvited guest has overwritten it.

It is then a simple matter of 
running Happy Face again.

Most people advise you to keep the
write-protect on.  At Budgie UK, we
do precisely the OPPOSITE !

If a virus is lurking amongst your
disks, the last thing you want to
do is to leave it there unchallenged. 
Leaving the write-protect off is
the bait required: as soon as the
greeting fails to appear, all disks
are tested until the virus is isolated
