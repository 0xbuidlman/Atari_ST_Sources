Readme file for STrEet Fighter 2 sources by Patrice Mandin

You need my macro files for system calls (sysinc.zip on my web site)
You need an Atari which has a blitter, hardware scrolling and dma sound:
an Atari STE or an Atari Falcon to run the final program.
You also need Devpac to assemble the programs:

1) Assemble the player's file

There is only Chun Li file as a player, so:
In devpac, set assembly options to Atari Executable, and assemble CHUNLI\CHUN_LI.S
Change the 'output' in this file to your path (it must be the same as the sf2_93.s
file). At the end, you will have chunli.prg, which contains sprites, sounds and
control for this character.

2) Assemble the main program

Load sf2_93.s and assemble it (same remark for 'output' than before).

3) Play

Run sf2_ste.tos 
It runs on Ste and Falcon (tested on RVB, maybe work on VGA).

4) Informations

CHUNLI\AVR contains the sounds
CHUNLI\SPR contains the sprites used in the program (raw format, 4 bitplanes)
CHUNLI\IFF contains the source images for the sprites (load them as blocks
in Deluxe Paint)
I am sorry all comments in the source are in French, but so I am.
