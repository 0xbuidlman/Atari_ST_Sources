	I wrote this 68000 code to run in a 68000 based scale that I 
built.  I am looking for any information out there that anyone may 
have on floating point stuff for the 68000.  The scale that I am 
building needs some floating point routines so it can be software
calibrated and so it can count things.  Hope someone can use this 
code!  I will Upload any other useful routines that I code or 
otherwise come across.  I can be reached at that following:
