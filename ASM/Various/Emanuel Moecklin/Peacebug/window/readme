     This program is able to let PEACEBUG run in a window, a very useful
     feature if you want to keep your eyes on the original screen. It's
     also very useful if you have a built-in gfx board which does not
     allow you to set the screenbase address.
     Window only uses the officially documented features of PEACEBUG's
     interface, and of course it can be started as accessory or as program.

     PEACEBUG uses own screen routines and can also be called from an
     interrupt, so naturally there can be problems with the AES. Because of
     that, Window switches the debugger's output back to the original screen
     if the work space of the window is overlapped by another window (the
     window doesn't have to be the top one). All problems are not removed by
     this procedure, e.g. if a dialog box covers the window, it will be
     destroyed if the debugger pops up.
     Window checks regulary if the work space isn't covered, (every 1/10
     second), and decides whether to switch the screen or not.

     If you are interested in the source code, please send me a formatted
     disk or an e-mail. You will then receive the newest version in the
     same way. Bug reports and suggestions are also welcome.
