     These utilities are examples of how the interface of the debugger can
     be programmed.


     CACHEADD
     --------
     Adds a certain number of entries to the two caches. In the source you
     can fix how many additional entries you want.

     CALLPB_1
     --------
     Calls the debugger by CALL_DEBUGGER_1. If you want to start programs
     from the debugger, you should always call the debugger that way.

     CALLPB_2
     --------
     Calls the debugger by CALL_DEBUGGER_2. If you want to call OS func-
     tions from the debugger, you should always call the debugger that way.
     The difference between the two call routines is, that CALL_DEBUGGER_1
     sets all stack pointers to own memory areas. CALL_DEBUGGER_2 does not
     change any registers.

     GETREZ
     ------
     Sets the resolution of the debugger according to Getrez (XBIOS 4).
     This is useful if you are working with virtual resolutions (e.g. with
     protos or bigscreen). As the debugger has its own screen, the screen-
     expander cannot come into action and the screen will be messed up.
     This can be fixed with this program, as it urges the debugger to use
     the real (physical) resolution.

     HISTORY
     -------
     Adds certain number of entries to the history buffer. It is
     bytes= entries*length of one line.

     INIT_SCR
     --------
     If a gfx board driver installs after the debugger, the debugger won't
     recognize it. With this program PEACEBUG allocates a new screen.

     INVERT
     ------
     Inverts the debugger's fonts.

     NEWFONT
     -------
     Installs a new screen font. The font is included in the program. If
     you prefer another font, you have to assemble it once again.

     USERTRAC
     --------
     Installs a user trace routine and turns on trace mode (TRACE -) after-
     wards. You have to change the break condition in the source code. It's
     set to D0.l=-1 by way of trial and error.
