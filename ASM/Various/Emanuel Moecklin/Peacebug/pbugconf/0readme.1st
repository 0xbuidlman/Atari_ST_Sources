For translating PBUGCONF, you need the Pure Assembler.
PBUGCONF.PRJ is the project file. Use this file and
you won't have any problems translating it.
GERMAN.S and ENGLISH.S are the resource files as
assembly code. If you change the resource files,
you also have to rewrite this two files (or at
least one of them).
