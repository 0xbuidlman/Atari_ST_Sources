     -O- 128 Byte  Drum Machine -O-

As  an  encouragement  to  musicians  to
code their own music drivers,  I release
this  drum machine   to  illustrate  how
simple  and  fun   YM  drivers  can  be!

Features:
---------

 *  Programmable  8  step  drum  machine
 *  Bad-ass hihat,  kick and snare drums
 *  Jam along in realtime - press a key!
 *  Source code included  ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)

Have fun!
