
MAG 1  ST-PLUG volume 12  April 1990  (d/sided)
The latest magazine on disk from North America.
ST-PLUG was originally conceived by Dan Panke as an on-line ST magazine.
Now at last available in disk form, it brings the latest news and
reviews from across the pond. In addition, utilities, accessories
and other useful programs are included in compressed, self-extracting
format. The in-built PERUSER allows ascii files and degas pictures
to be viewed together.

MAG 2  MAGGIE 1.0  by The Lost Boys  (d/sided)
The zaniest disk magazine around! And it's from The Lost Boys, of course.
Humour, news, hot gossip, extraordinary built-in demos, tips,
programming in GFA, interviews with Bob Hay and other characters,
games and demos reviews. The style is totally unconventional. 
The effect is shattering.

MAG 3  ST-PLUG volume 13  June 1990  (d/sided)
More reviews and information from Dan Panke.
Two folders full of self-decompacting utilities and accessories.
In all, enough to fill two double-sided disks.
