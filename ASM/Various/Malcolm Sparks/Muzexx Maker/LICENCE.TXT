LICENCE DETAILS FOR MUZEXX MAKER:

          All data produced by the MUZEXX MAKER can be used in other 
program such as games. If you wish to do this an example program is 
provided. However, if the data is to be used in a commercial product a 
licence must be purchased even if the music module is not used. No other 
acknowledgement is necessery although any mention would be very much 
appreciated.

A licence to use music for a full-priced game would be negotiable but 
would be in the region of œ30. This may seem a lot but I feel this is 
reasonable for the time saved and also because the program itself is free.
If you or your software house/publisher would like to buy a full licence 
which covers all future games then please contact the address below.

If you wish to purchase a licence agreement please write to me at the
