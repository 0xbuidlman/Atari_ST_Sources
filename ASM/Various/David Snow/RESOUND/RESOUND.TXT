"Play digitized sound file when terminating a program"
(in the author's words)
Whenever you leave a program it will play the sound you
specified!

Documentation and Assembly source code included,
as well as an example of an .inf file to specify the
digitized sample.  It DID include a Bugs Bunny sample,
but it just about quadrupled the length of the archive.
Besides who wants to hear "Eh... What's up Doc?" every
time you leave a program!!? 

I searched my Gauntlet disk, and got the sample that
Gauntlet played every time you go down an exit.
Any .SPL file will do. (Remember it resides in memory,
so you don't want it TOO long!)
