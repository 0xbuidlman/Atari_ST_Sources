
     RESOUND is a silly little utility that, once loaded, plays a 
     digitized sound file each time you exit an application.  Any 
     standard SPL or SND file can be used.  The name of the chosen 
     sound file and its appropriate sampling rate are passed to 
     RESOUND in an ASCII file called RESOUND.INF.  This file 
     consists of:

          a digit from 0 to 5 representing the sampling rate (see below);
          a single space;
          and the complete name of the sound file.

     For example:

               3 WHATSUP.SPL
          or:
               2 WISEGUY.SND

     The sampling rates are designated as follows:

          0 -  4.9  kHz
          1 -  7.68 kHz
          2 -  9.6  kHz
          3 - 14.99 kHz
          4 - 19.8  kHz
          5 - 30.7  kHz

     To install RESOUND from the desktop, double click on 
     RESOUND.PRG.  The sound file, RESOUND.PRG and RESOUND.INF 
     must be in the same directory when the program is run.

     To install RESOUND from an auto folder, place only the 
     RESOUND.PRG file in the auto folder, and place RESOUND.INF 
     and the sound file in the boot directory.

     The program and the sound file stay resident in memory until 
     you reboot (keep this in mind if you run out of memory when 
     attempting to run another application).  RESOUND does not 
     check to see if it has been previously installed, so if you 
     install it twice without rebooting, it will just gobble up 
     more RAM.

     There must be some practical use for this.  Damned if I can 
     think of one.
