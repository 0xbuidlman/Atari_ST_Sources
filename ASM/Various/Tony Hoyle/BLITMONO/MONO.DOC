This program is Public Domain.  It may be freely copied or distributed
as long as the archive is left intact.  It should contain the three 
files:
		MONO.PRG
		MONO.S
		MONO.DOC
		





Instructions
------------

This program sits in your AUTO folder, and does not become active unless
you hold down Control and Left Shift during bootup.  Once the program
is active you have what is effectively a Mono ST, running at about 71% of
normal speed.  When used with QUICK-ST you won't notice the speed drop at
all.

The present version is for the STE only, but could be converted if anyone
wants to try.  The only changes needed are references to $FF820D, which is
the screen low-byte on the STE.

Future updates will be loaded onto CIX as soon as I write them.
