
 Hop hop !! Don't you know you now have
    the Necro-Patch in your drive??

 It allows you to view all the parts of
   the lousy-bugged demo by Hemoroids

            N E C R O S Y S

Since it took me only an hour to realize
this fucking patch, I wonder why I didnt
make it sooner, anyway, if you once meet
me in some of those dark alleys, I allow
 you to kick my ass, I guess I deserved
 it !!  Of course, as a matter of fact,
the "patch" is bugged also... Of course!
  A demo isn't a real demo without its 
own collection of bugs, anyway Zappy may
 tell you more on that subject... Hihi!

Well enjoy that demo as much as I did to
create it... (Actually, it's a lie becoz
it sounded like a pain in the Hemoroids
to me! Arf')

Some parts may bug with that patch but I
  can assure you they work correctly on 
  disk, even if the disk bugs... Boarf!

   But remember: Pift/Aglo roulzes!
