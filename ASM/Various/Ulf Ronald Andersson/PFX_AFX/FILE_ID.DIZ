xPFX & xAFX revision K (URAn 1994.10)
xPFX == extended PFX packer      (based on Questers PFXPAK 2.1)
xAFX == extended AFX auto-unpacker  (based on Questers AFX 2.1)
The new revision K (1994.10.01) improves xPFX batch operation,
and  corrects  a few  minor  remaining bugs &  insufficiencies.
xAFX, on the other hand,  is almost unchanged from revision  J.
Both programs run successfully with  MultiTOS 1.08, MagiX 2.01,
Geneva release 003, and NeoDesk 4 release 001.
The program 'SUPX.PRG' is included to fix MagiX 'Supexec' bug.
