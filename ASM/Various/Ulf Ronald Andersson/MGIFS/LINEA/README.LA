For those without linea routines, these are some that I wrote and which
I use in mgif. Build the objects (make -f mk) and add them to OBJS in
mgif makefile. Or add them to a library and change LIBS in mgif makefile.

Note: the .o files here are Alcyon format (which should also work with
Sozobon, though I have not tested them). For other compilers, like MWC,
you will need to rebuild the objects from source.
