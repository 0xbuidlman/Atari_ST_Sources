----------NOTE:
        CSI code starts most of ansi control sequences. It is
        assumed it has the hex value of 9B for 8-bits-chars-systems
        and it can be replaced by the two chars ESC [ (hex 1B 5B)
        for 7-bits-chars-systems.

        In the descriptions of the sequences variable parameters
        are indicated by Pn (where n can be a number, e.g.
        P1, P2, ...). Parameters are given -- where not otherwise
        noted -- as numeric values in their
        ASCII rapresentation: e.g. the parameter 40 should be given
        as two-chars-sequence 34 30 (hex values).
