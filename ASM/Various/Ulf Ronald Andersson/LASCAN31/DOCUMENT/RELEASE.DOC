Section 3:	Copyright & Release Conditions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Copyright:     (c)1994 by Ulf Ronald Andersson.
		All rights reserved.

 Shareware:     Rights to distribution and use are released under the
                following 10 conditions:

 1: Anyone wishing to distribute or use the LaceScan package, or parts of it,
    in any fashion not covered in, or opposed to, conditions 2-10 below,
    must first contact me and receive my approval.
    Any such distribution or use without seeking (and receiving) my approval,
    will constitute a criminal act.

 2: No distributor/publisher may charge more than UK œ1.00, US $2.00
    or DM 3.00 (whichever is most) above media+mailing costs for LaceScan.

 3: No distributor/publisher may in any way alter the folder/file package
    as defined in the LaceScan manifest (Section 2: 'Package Manifest').

 4: Any additions on distribution disks/archives must be made outside of the
    original LaceScan package, which may then be included either as a packed
    archive or as a normal folder, provided no alien files are inserted.
    Such a LaceScan package may then be placed on a disk or in an archive
    regardless of whether other packages share the same disk/archive or not,
    _but_ condition 2 above then applies to the entire collection !

 5: The name of a LaceScan folder/archive for distribution must always be of
    the form "LASCANxx.yyy, where 'xx' is the version number*10 and 'yyy'
    is an optional name extension that may be chosen freely.
    Eg: I distributed version 2.9 as an archive named LASCAN29.ZIP .

 6: Unregistered LaceScan users have the right to operate the programs for
    one month, since that should certainly be sufficient time to decide if
    the program is worth registering or not.

 7: To become a registered LaceScan user, you need simply send me the amount
    that you consider appropriate for a software package of the nature and
    quality which you deem LaceScan to have. You will then receive important
    rights stated below, in addition to the permanent right to use LaceScan,
    in person or by single proxy.

 8: Registered LaceScan users have the right to turn to me for advice on how
    best to use the LaceScan package, and how to construct programs that are
    resolution independent.  Such inquiries should however include enough
    money (bills, check, or money order) to cover return postage.
    Unregistered users will not get any replies, but are still welcome to
    send me bug reports and/or improvement suggestions.

 9: Registered LaceScan users have the right to freely distribute the several
    specialized screen emulators that I will soon (I hope) release, for use
    with programs of their own development.
    These emulators will be much smaller than LaceScan/Lace_Emu, and will be
    extremely simple to use, but internally use methods similar to Lace_Emu.
    Eg: A developer of a TT specific program, needing TT-high, may wish to
        include a TT-high emulator for the benefit of his ST users.
    
10: All users of LaceScan must take full responsibility for any and all
    possible consequences arising from such use, regardless of causes.

 This completes the conditions for LaceScan use and distribution.

 The following address is to be used for contacting me.

	Ulf Ronald Andersson
	H”ders V„g 7
	S-14570 Norsborg
	Sweden

NB: The letters '”' and '„' in the street address are swedish characters,
    but may be replaced by 'o' and 'a' or even 'oe' and 'ae' instead.

 Since a dialog by mail is very slow, some users (at least in Sweden)
 may prefer to call me by phone using the phone number below:

	08 - 53184105

 The first two digits are the area code for Stockholm, so foreign callers
 must remove the leading zero. (And of course start by dialling Sweden.)

=============================================================================
Section 4:	Introduction to the LaceScan Package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to guarantee each user a fully functional package I have made it
 a copyright requirement that distributors must leave the LaceScan archive
 (or folder) without alterations of any kind. I have myself wasted countless
 hours in trying to get PD or shareware programs to behave as advertised,
 only to find that some program or document, referred to by the author,
 simply is not present on my distributors disk.
 My requirement should, hopefully, spare you similar troubles with LaceScan.

 CAUTION!

 If you are reading this for the first time, you probably have no backup yet.
 In that case I suggest that you make a copy of the entire package as soon as
 possible, and certainly before you make any changes to any of its files.
 
 Before we proceed with this introduction, I also want you to check that you
 have indeed received the entire package, in unmodified condition.
 Check your disk/folder/archive and make sure that every file listed in the
 manifest above (in Section 2) is present, and that nothing has been added
 into the main folder/archive of LaceScan.

 Should you note anything missing or added, BEWARE.
 If so, the disk has reached you through at least one copyright-breaker.
 Such people have no scruples, so remember also to check for viruses.
 ( If indeed they left you this text... )

patch: This section will be extended in future versions

=============================================================================
Section 5:	Installation of the LaceScan Package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the files from the AUTO folder of the LaceScan package in the \AUTO
folder of your boot drive.   That's all there is to it...!
Then read the documentation on how to actually use the stuff.
