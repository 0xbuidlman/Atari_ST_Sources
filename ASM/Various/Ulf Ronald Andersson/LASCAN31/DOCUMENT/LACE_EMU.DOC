In large screen emulation, it may be impractical to select the visible area
by dragging the mouse around, so keyboard commands for this have been added.
These commands are similar to those of LaceScan in that (initially) they all
require both shift keys to be pressed at the same time as a command key.

A special command may be used to modify this requirement, so that only the
right-shift key need be pressed with the command keys.
This makes keyboard control quite convenient, since most command keys are at
(or at least near) the cursor pad, for simple one-handed usage.

This unfortunately makes it harder to specify a complete key combination
since there are always two legal variants which must be mentioned.
Therefore the abbreviation 'cmd_' will be used to indicate the the currently
active combination of shift key/keys.

Thus cmd_Help means that the 'Help' key is pressed together with either the
right shift alone, or with both shift keys, depending on the active mode.

The table below shows Lace_Emu command-keys, including old LaceScan commands.

Cmd_key	Resulting action
-------	---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Escape   Toggle between right-shift and dual-shift modes for commands.

 Undo     Toggle autoswitch between normal and overscan display.
 Insert   Invert overscan border colour, and clear borders to that colour.
 Clr/Home Toggle automatic clearing of overscan borders, and clear them.

 Delete   Toggle mouse control of display position on emulated screen on/off.
 Backspc  Move display to top left of emulated screen.
 Help     Move display to center of emulated screen,
Up Arrow  Move display to top of emulated screen, but not horizontally.
Down  ''  Move display to bottom of emulated screen but not horizontally.
Left  ''  Move display to left edge of emulated screen, but not vertically.
Right ''  Move display to right edge of emulated screen, but not vertically.

Num. '+'  Change (wrapping) to next filter usable by current emulation.
Num. '-'  Change (wrapping) to preceding filter usable by current emulation.

Personally I prefer to use mouse control for most things except for
finding/leaving centered dialogs, since cmd_Help/cmd_Backspc are so
much more convenient for this.
cmd_Backspc is often the quickest way to get the GEM menu displayed.

cmd_num_plus and cmd_num_minus are the best way to switch filters, especially
when you only want a quick overview with higher (but slow) pixel compression.

Note that whenever a command key is used to move the display of an emulated
screen, the mouse is also centered in the new display area, even though this
may not become visible until the mouse is touched again.

The same kind of mouse centering is also used when switching emulation
filter from the Set_Lace accessory, but until the mouse is moved a second
'click' will still hit the same spot.  This means you can easily get back
to good visibility if you make an unsuitable filter switch.
