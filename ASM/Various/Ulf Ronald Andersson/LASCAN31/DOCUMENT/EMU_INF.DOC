;
;	This document describes the syntax required for LACE_EMU.INF files,
;	and is itself written according those rules.
;	(The Lace_Emu.INF supplied has similar commands, but less text.)
;
;	The syntax of such INF_files is as follows:
;	-------------------------------------------
;
;	All lines starting with semi-colon are remarks, that will be ignored
;	when Lace_Emu or Set_Lace loads an emulator INF file.
;	Also, if a command is followed by a semi-colon on the same line,
;	then the rest of that line is also treated as such a remark.
;
;	Spacing may use both spaces and tabs, and is completely optional.
;	Numbers need termination consisting of at least one non_digit,
;	which may be either a space, a tab, or end of line.
;
;	Any lowercase characters in real commands are translated to uppercase
;	before the command is interpreted by Lace_Emu.
;
;	In my command examples (on remark lines) lowercase words represent
;	binary or decimal numbers that are defined by the user (you that is).
;
;
;	Command lines have the following 2 formats:
;	-------------------------------------------
;
;	S = mask keys				;define LaceScan setup keys
;	keys = xrez yrez planes rez slot filter	;define Lace_Emu setup keys
;
;	Here, 'mask' and 'keys' are 6 digit binary numbers, whereas 'xrez',
;	'yrez', 'planes', 'rez', 'slot', and 'filter' are all decimal.
;
;	If any commands for Lace_Emu are duplicated, those latest in the
;	file are taken as valid, and if a file is later loaded by Set_Lace
;	this will only replace the definitions included in that file.
;
;	If any command in a file has bad syntax, that command and the
;	entire remainder of the file is ignored.
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	Define LaceScan setup keys as follows:
;	--------------------------------------
;
;	S = mask keys
;
;	mask	controls which buttons/keys will be tested (1's) or ignored.
;	keys	indicates buttons/keys pressed (1's) or released for setup.
;
;	Bit 5 (top bit) of 'mask' and 'keys' represents the left mouse button
;	and the next lower bit (bit 4) represents the right mouse button.
;	The low 4 bits correspond to the the bits of a bios Kbshift value,
;	So bit3=Alternate, bit2=Control, bit1=Left_Shift, bit0=Right_Shift.
;
;	This is the key combination which at desktop init (& rez change),
;	will cause LaceScan to enter 'Setup mode' for user customization.
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;	The following definition of LaceScan setup keys is my favorite,
;	since it has nothing in common with most key/mouse combinations
;	that I prefer to use for resolution control.
;

 S  =	111111	001101		;<Alt><Ctl><rSh> for LaceScan setup
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	Define Lace_Emu setup keys as follows:
;	--------------------------------------
;
;	keys = xrez yrez planes rez slot filter
;
;	keys	indicates keys pressed (1's) or released (0's)
;	xrez	is the horizontal resolution to be emulated
;	yrez	is the vertical resolution to be emulated
;	planes	is the number of bitplanes to be emulated
;	rez	is an ST shifter code (0..2) to be emulated
;	slot	is a LaceScan slot number, defining physical screen
;	filter	is a Lace_Emu filter code (0..6) for emulation method
;
;NB:	Detailed specifications for each of these parameters are given
;	further on in this text.
;
;	If a button/key combination defined this way is used during desktop
;	init, or resolution change, the corresponding emulation is activated.
;
;	If you define a combination with '000000' as 'keys', this becomes a
;	default mode, since it represents the case where no buttons or keys
;	are pressed, letting an emulation be activated without user input.
;	This is a good way to choose rez via 'AsaStart' or 'XBoot' etc...,
;	simply by copying various LACE_EMU.INF files to the boot 'root'.
;
;	Up to 64 emulator modes can be defined with individual setup key
;	combinations, but some are inconvenient (need three hands), whereas
;	others may cause conflicts with other software.
;	Eg: TOS 2.06 will not load DESKICON.RSC or accessories if <Control>
;	    is pressed during desktop init or resolution change.
;
;	It is also necessary to avoid conflict between Lace_Emu setup keys
;	and LaceScan setup keys, since the latter have higher priority.
;	This means that if you try to activate an emulation using the same
;	combination as LaceScan setup, the emulation is aborted.
;
;	In practice (with TOS 2.06) this gives 27 convenient combinations,
;	of which 1 is used for LaceScan and the rest for various emulations.
;
;
;	Parameter specifications:
;	-------------------------
;
;	'xrez' must always be some multiple of 32, and the total result of
;	'(xrez * yrez * planes)/8' must not exceed 153600, since that is
;	the amount of memory reserved by Lace_Emu for emulated screen.
;	(The memory usage may become variable in a future version)
;
;	Some programs may require that 'xrez' be a multiple of some high
;	binary power (eg: 64) or even some specific value.  These are BUGS
;	in those programs, which should be replaced by resolution independent
;	programs where possible.
;	
;
;	Use '1' for 'xrez' to disable a built-in default without defining
;	a new resolution.  The rest of that definition will be ignored,
;	but only after testing legality, so keep to the rules anyway.
;
;
;	'yrez' should always be a multiple of 40, since all Atari resolutions
;	have always used such multiples, and some TOS assume so in some of the
;	calculations for text cell positions.
;	Lace_Emu only demands that 'yrez' be non-zero, so you may test this.
;
;
;	'planes' is at present limited to 1, 2, or 4, and may not exceed
;	the number of planes used by the physical screen during emulation.
;	Thus, TT_HIGH can be emulated in ST_MEDIUM, but not vice versa.
;	In fact (as yet) 'planes' must be the same number of planes as used
;	by the physical resolution, except when emulating mono in medium.
;	This limitation may be removed in a future version.
;
;
;	'rez' is the resolution code passed to xbios during initial setup
;	of an emulation mode, and should be 2-log2('planes'), or simpler:
;
;		0  if 'planes' = 4
;		1  if 'planes' = 2
;		2  if 'planes' = 1
;
;
;	'slot' should be the number of a LaceScan screen definition slot
;	defining the physical rez of the emulation .
;	Normally slot 0 will be used for emulation with 16 colours, and
;	slot 1 will be used for all other emulation on colour monitor/TV,
;	whereas slot 2 is the standard choice for emulation on mono monitor.
;	Other slot numbers may be useful to allow temporary use of differing
;	monitors that need individual LaceScan setup data.
;
;	The slot data is used to center and limit visible screen.
;
;	If overscan switch is turned off the emulation will use standard rez
;	for the physical display, so emulation is possible even on an STE.
;
;
;	'Filter' is a code selecting various emulation methods.
;	At present the following are defined:
;
;	Filter	Effect
;	------	-------------------------------------------------------------
;	  0	This is a dummy filter code, used to disable emulator, while
;		still using the LaceScan 'slot' code to choose resolution.
;		The other four parameters are not used, but must nevertheless
;		obey the syntax rules.  With this setting the resolution used
;		will also depend on the state of the overscan switch.
;
;	  1	Emulates mono-res in medium: 1 visible line per 2 emulated
;		This makes up to 832*560 pixels continuously visible, so that
;		scrolling is only necessary for huge formats (max = 1280*960)
;		The picture quality in this mode is of course a bit coarse.
;
;	  2	Emulates mono-res in medium: 1 visible line per 1 emulated
;		This mode has perfect picture quality, but gives the same
;		aspect ratio as medium res, with only 832*280 pixels visible.
;		The max size is still 1280*960, but requires more scrolling.
;
;	  3	Emulates large screen for any resolution with same bitplanes,
;		showing 1 visible line per 1 emulated
;		This filter preserves all picture data, for perfect clarity.
;		This is the most general filter, used to enlarge the virtual
;		screen area of any resolution. Its maximum sizes are:
;		Low 	=>  640*480 (or  768*400) with up to 416*280 visible
;		Medium	=> 1280*480 (or 1024*600) with up to 832*280 visible
;		High	=> 1280*960 (or 1536*800) with up to 720*480 visible 
;
;	  4	Emulates high screen for medium or low resolution,
;		showing 1 visible line per 2 emulated.
;		This filter produces a picture much like that of filter 1,
;		but is used with TOS in colour mode, and is MUCH slower.
;		It is intended to give a good overview of a high screen, but
;		is not intended for continuous use, so use filter 3 instead.
;
;	  5	This is an experimental filter intended to emulate TT-Low.
;		Unfortunately this emulation does not (as yet) work, even
;		though the filter appears to work correctly.
;		Any suggestions for how to implement 8 planes are welcomed.
;
;	  6	Emulates high screen for monochrome resolution.
;		Displays 1 visible line per 2 emulated, like filters 1 & 4,
;		with speed somewhere between that of those filters.
;		The effect is very similar to that of filter 1, but since
;		it uses a mono-monitor it allows up to 704*960 visible pix,
;		so that the maximum 1280*960 needs no vertical scrolling.
;
;	  7	Emulates wide screen for monochrome resolution.
;		Combines pixel pairs horizontally, with no vertical change.
;		This gives the same aspect ratio as normal medium resolution,
;		with speed somewhat slower than filter 6.
;		This filter needs no horizontal scrolling for TT-high, even
;		when used on an STE (without overscan).
;
;	  8	Emulates huge screen for monochrome resolution.
;		Combines pixel pairs both vertically & horizontally, so that
;		the entire 1280*960 TT screen is displayed as 640*480.
;		So, in overscan mode, TT-high is entirely visible !!!
;		This mode is of course very coarse in quality, and slow,
;		but is necessary to inspect TT-high graphic layouts with the
;		proper aspect ratio, and with whole area visible.
;		I use this to inspect picture or document layouts only,
;		switching to filter 3 or 6 directly afterwards.
;
;	  9	Emulates low resolution in medium resolution.
;		Converts all colours except black and white to grey, like
;		filter 4, but allows far greater visible area.
;		This makes up to 832*280 pixels visible.
;		Its only use is for programs that demand 4 bitplanes, but
;		require greater visible area than possible in normal lorez.
;
;	 10...	Future filters are planned to include colour emulation for
;		mono monitors, but these are not yet finished (slow...),
;		so the above filters will have to suffice for now.
;
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;Note:	New kyboard commands have been added (cmd_num_plus & cmd_num_minus)
;	to allow filter changes inside programs that allow no accessories.
;
;Note:	Avoid emulating resolutions of 640*400 pixels with TOS 2.06, since
;	this will make further resolution changes impossible until RESET.
;	The same may be true of some other TOS versions also.
;	(and NeoDesk4 refuses to allow ANY rez change in monochrome modes)
;
;Note:	With NVDI any rez with more than 400 lines will automatically
;	get the same object & font proportions as mono-res.
;	This makes desktop very cumbersome with large colour emulations.
;	This never happens with the built-in VDI, but does correspond to
;	the behaviour of TT/Falcon in the use of fonts in high resolutions.
;
;Note:	The above note is also true for MagiX, since its VDI is written by
;	the same authors as NVDI and so uses very similar algorithms.
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;	These 23 combinations are those I use for resolution control.
