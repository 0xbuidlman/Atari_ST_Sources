 This document is not yet finished..., but the program SET_LACE.ACC does
 contain an info dialog that should be sufficient for normal use.

 SET_LACE.ACC will run as a normal program if you rename it to SET_LACE.PRG,
 in which case you may also prefer to set the fastload flag of the program.
 (But never do that on an accessory if you have TOS 1.4 or older TOS !!!)

 Set_Lace has controls to manipulate the hardware palette, and to govern
 the emulation parameters of Lace_Emu, including the ability to load/reload
 LACE_EMU.INF files in preparation of resolution changes.  A similar INF
 file loader has been prepared for LaceScan, and will be activated once I
 finally decide on the exact file format to be used. It is as yet disabled.

 Additionally Set_Lace always contains two info strings telling the current
 resolution (X-rez Y-rez planes) and the amount of memory currently free.
 These strings have formats as in the following two examples:

 'Rez = 800 x 280 x 2'	(I was using overscanned medium rez.)
 'KB free RAM = 2190'	(This means 2190 * 1024 bytes, of course.)

 The numerical fields will naturally adapt to the current size of the values.
 The free RAM size presented represents only the largest continuous block of
 free bytes, since that is the limit of size for any new blocks you may need.
 So this number need not always change as RAM is allocated, if it happens to
 be taken from some other, smaller, free block. (A result of fragmentation.)

 The buttons to control the emulator will only be visible if LaceScan and
 Lace_Emu are both running and emulation is active, otherwise you will see
 one of the strings 'No compatible emulator.' or 'Emulator not active.'
 in their stead.
