This document is not yet finished..., but a small tip may be needed:

Just put LACE_MUS.PRG in your \AUTO folder, then boot in various resolutions
to try out the mouse, and remember that you can always press left shift key
for as long as you need an unspeeded mouse.

The basic difference between this and other mouse accelerators is that
Lace_Mus adapts automatically to the logical screen size of any resolution.
This includes all emulated resolutions as well (and as needed).
I do not recommend trying to use an unspeeded Atari mouse in TT-high !!!

If you decide that you don't like this mouse speeder, simply remove it from
the \AUTO folder again.  No other part of LaceScan requires Lace_Mus, which
is provided merely to make work in _huge_ resolutions more convenient.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note 1:	Early versions had some problems due to packet pointers being passed
	in a0 only, guided by documentation in various (erroneous) books.
	As of version 1.1 packet pointers are also passed on stack, as for
	most routine arguments, and identically to how TOS does the job.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note 2:	After _much_ experimentation I have decided too remove most of the
	vector-linked code previously used to smooth Lace_Mus movement.
	Too many other programs accessed these vectors _ILLEGALLY_, by not
	following any recommended (by Atari) procedures and protocols, so
	to make Lace_Mus compatible with these I had to avoid those vectors.

	This means Lace_Mus may be (a little) jerky in moving the mouse.
	Even so, I still prefer it to all other mouse accelerators.
