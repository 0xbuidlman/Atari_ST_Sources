Small doc for P.G, just a keyguide:

PG is copyright (c) 1990, Pontus Skold.
No part of it may be sold without a prior permision
by the author.

If you're a lamer, you will not be able to use P.G, get lost !

Installing the P.G you have 2 options. 
You can press "I" to install an interupt to reinstall the 
P.G resetrout again after running for example some resetprof demo.

You can also press the key "B" to boot from a disc. 
In those cases it would be nice if the P.G code were located in 
the high mem(If you have a 1040, it should be placed in the high half). 
This can be done by running a ramdisc prg before installing P.G. 

Allright, P.G s main part is after the reset, you only have to reset
with P.G. in memory to be able to grab from most progs.
