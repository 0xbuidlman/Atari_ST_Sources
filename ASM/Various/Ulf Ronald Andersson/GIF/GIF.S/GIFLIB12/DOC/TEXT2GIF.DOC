			Text2Gif
			--------

Program to generate gif images out of regular text. Text can be one line
or multi line, and is converted using 8 by 8 fix font.

Usage:
------

Usage: Text2Gif [-q] [-s ClrMapSize] [-f FGClr] [-c R G B] [-t "Text"] [-h]

  Text2Gif read stdin if no text is provided in the command line (-t),
and will dump the created GIF file to stdout.


Memory required:
----------------

Line.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-s ClrMapSize] explicitly defines the size of the color map of the
   resulting gif image. Usually the image will be bicolor with fg as color
   1, unless [-f] is explicitly given in case the color map size will be
   big enough to hold it. However it is sometimes convenient to set the
   color map size to certain size while the fg color is small mainly so
   this image may be merged with another (images must match color map size).
3. [-f FG] : select foreground index (background is always 0). By default
   it is one and therefore the image result is bicolored.
   if FG is set to n then color map will be created with 2^k entries where
   2^k > n for minimum k, assuming k <= 8. This color map will be all zeros
   except this forground index. This option is useful if this text image
   should be integrated into other image colormap using their colors.
4. [-c R G B] : The color to use as the foreground color. While by default.
5. [-t "Text"] : in case of one line text, it can be provided on the command
   line. Note you must encapsulate the Text within quotes if it has spaces
   (The quotes themselves are not part of the text). If no -t option is
   provided, stdin is read until end of file.
6. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.

Notes:
------
   There is a hard bound limit on the number of lines, and it is set to 100.
