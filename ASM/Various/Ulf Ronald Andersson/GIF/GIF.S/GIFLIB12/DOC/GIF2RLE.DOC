			-------

Program to convert images saved as GIF to RLE (utah raster toolkit) format.


Usage:

Usage: Gif2Rle [-q] [-a] [-h] GifFile

If no GifFile is given, Gif2Rle will try to read stdin for GIF file.


Memory required:
----------------

Screen.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-a] : Add alpha channel (see rle document) to the output data file.n
3. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.

Notes:
------
  This routine must be linked with the rle toolkit library librle.a.
As you want to convert images to RLE format, it is reasonable to assume you
have this library available...
