			GifBG
			-----

Program to generate Back Ground with optionally gradually changing intensity
in any of the basic 8 directions, as a GIF file.

Usage:
------

Usage: GifBG [-q] [-d Dir] [-l #Lvls] [-c R G B] [-m MinI] [-M MaxI]
								[-s W H] [-h]

  GifBG reads no input, and will dump the created GIF file to stdout.


Memory required:
----------------

Line.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-d Dir] : select direction the intensity of the background should increase.
   Direction can be one of the 8 principle directions:
   "T" - for Top		"TR" - for Top Right
   "R" - for Right		"BR" - for Bottom Right
   "B" - for Bottom		"BL" - for Bottom Left
   "L" - for left		"TL" - for Top Left
     The compass directions may be use as synonym for the above directions, so
   for example "NE" is equal to "TR".
     Direction is case insensitive.
     Default direction is Top (North).
3. [-l #Lvls] : Number of levels the color is going to be scaled to.
   Default is 16.
4. [-c R G B] : The color to use as the primary back ground color to scale.
     This color is scaled between the minimum intensity (MinI) and maximum
   intensity (MaxI) from one end of the screen to the end as defined by Dir.
   see below (-m & -M) for MinI & MaxI. Default is Blue (0, 0, 255).
5. [-m MinI] : Minimum intensity (in percent) to scale color. Default 10%
6. [-M MaxI] : Maximum intensity (in percent) to scale color. Default 100%
7. [-s W H] : Size of image to create. Default 640 by 350.
8. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.

Notes:
------
  If MinI == MaxI = 100 (%) and #Lvls == 2 then boolean mask image of specified
size will be created - all forground. This can be used as a square mask for
gifcomb utility.
