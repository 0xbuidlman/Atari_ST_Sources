			GifHisto
			--------

Program to create histogram of number of pixels using each color. Output
can be formated into a GIF histogram file, or text file - both goes to
stdout.


Usage:
------

Usage: GifHisto [-q] [-t] [-s Width Height] [-n ImageNumber] [-b] [-h] GifFile

  If no GifFile is given, GifHisto will try to read stdin for GIF file.

Memory required:
----------------

Line.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-t] : Force output to be text file of the form: Size of colormap lines
   each contains two integers: number of times color appeared, and color
   index. This in increasing color index order. This output can be fed
   directly to msdos SORT program if number of times color appears ordering
   is desired.
     The colrmap picked is the one to be used for the image to generate
   histogram for, as defined in GIF format.
3. [-s Width Height] : Size of GIF histogram file. The Height of the
   histogram should be power of 2 dividable by number of colors in colormap.
     Width sets the resolution (accuracy if you like) of the histogram as
   the maximum histogram bar is scaled to fit it.
4. [-n ImageNumber] : Image number to test. Default is one.
5. [-b] : Zeros the background color count. As only linear scale bars is
   supported and usually the background appears much more times then rest
   of colors, deleting back ground count will improve the scaling of other
   colors.
6. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.
