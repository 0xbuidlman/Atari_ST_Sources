			RGB2Gif
			-------

Program to convert 24 bit images to a GIF image using color quantization.


Usage:
------

Usage: RGB2Gif [-q] [-c #Colors] [-1] -s Width Height [-h] RGBFile

If no RGBFile is given, RGB2Gif will try to read stdin for GIF file.


Memory required:
----------------

Screen.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-c #Colors] specifies number of colors to use, in bits per pixels, so
   '-c 8' specifies actually 256 colors (maximum and default).
3. [-1] : Only one file in the format of RGBRGB... triplates (Each of R, G, B
   is a byte) is read from input. This file size is 3 * Width * Height (see
   '-s' below. If stdin is used for input, this option is implicitly applied.
   The default (if not '-1') is 3 files with the names RGBFile.R, RGBFile.G,
   RGBFile.B, each of which is Width * Height bytes.
4. [-s Width Height] specifies the size of the image to read.
5. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.

Notes:
------
  Due to 8088 limitation, on MSDOS, maximum image size can not exceed
64k pixels.
