			Rle2Gif
			-------

Program to convert images saved as RLE (utah raster toolkit) to GIF format.


Usage:
------

Usage: Rle2Gif [-q] [-c #Colors] [-h] RleFile

If no RleFile is given, Rle2Gif will try to read stdin for Rle file.


Memory required:
----------------

Screen.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-c #Colors] : Select size of color map in the output Gif file. #Colors
   should be given as the based 2 log of number of colors. Default is 8
   which is 256 colors, and which is also the maximum.
3. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.

Notes:
------
  As the RLE format allows full 24 bits per pixel (8 per primmery color)
Colors must be quantized to the number of colors as set by the [-c] option,
above. This process is quite slow. See the quantize.c file in the lib
directory for the reference for this quantization algorithm (median cut).
