			GifRotat
			--------

Program to rotate a gif image by an arbitrary angle.


Usage:
------

Usage: GifRotat -a Angle [-q] [-s Width Height] [-h] GifFile

If no GifFile is given, GifRotat will try to read stdin for GIF file.


Memory required:
----------------

Screen (of source image).


Options:
--------

1. -a Angle : Specifies the angle to rotate in degrees with respect to
   the X (horizontal) axis.
2. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.2
3. [-s Width Height] : Since rotated image will have the same image size as
   original, some parts of the image will by clipped out and lost. By
   specifing a (bigger) size explicitly using the '-s' option, these parts
   may be saved.
3. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.

Notes:
------

Image is rotated around its center. No filtering is performed on the output
which have identical color map as the input. This is mainly since filtering
will require color quantization which is very memory/time intensive and
out of MSDOS memory limits even for small images.
