			GifInto
			-------

Program to save stdin into a file with given name, iff the result file has
size bigger than specified (see below). This can be used to save result in
same files name we started a chain of pipes.

Usage:
------

Usage: GifInto [-q] [-s MinFileSize] [-h] GifFile

  GifInto always read from stdin for GIF file.

Memory required:
----------------

Line.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-s MinFileSize] : If file is less than MinFileSize, it is deleted and
   not renamed to given name. This will prevent from killing the file we
   start with along the pipe, if result is empty file, or none complete.
   The default for file size is 14 bytes which is 1 bigger than GIF file
   stamp (6 bytes) and GIF file screen descriptor (7 bytes), so GIF file with
   only GIF stamp and screen descriptor will not be renamed.
3. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.
