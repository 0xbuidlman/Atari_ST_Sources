			GifText
			-------

Program to print (text only) general information about GIF file

Usage:
------

Usage: GifText [-q] [-c] [-e] [-z] [-p] [-r] [-h] GifFile

  If no GifFile is given, GifText will try to read stdin for GIF file.
  As giftext can generate huge amount of data, ^C will kill it, but 'q' will
stop only the printing (of one of -e, -z, -p), while file integrity will still
be checked.


Memory required:
----------------

Line.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-c] : Dumps also color maps.
3. [-e] : Dumps also encoded bytes - the pixels after compressed using LZ
   algorithm and chained to form bytes. This is the form the data is saved
   in the GIF file. Dumps in hex - 2 digit per byte.
4. [-z] : Dumps also the LZ codes of the image. Dumps in hex - 3 digits per
   code (as we are limited to 12 bits).
5. [-p] : Dumps aslo the pixels of the image. Dumps in hex - 2 digit per
   pixel (<=byte).
6. [-r] : Dumps raw pixels as one byte per pixel. This option inhibit all other
   options and only the pixels are dumped. This option may be used to convert
   gif file into raw data. Note the color map can be extracted by gifclrmp
   utility. If more than one image exists, all images will be dumped in order.
7. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.
