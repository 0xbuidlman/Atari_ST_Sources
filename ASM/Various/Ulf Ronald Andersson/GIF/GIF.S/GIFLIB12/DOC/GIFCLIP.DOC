			GifClip
			-------

Program to clip images in GIF files. Only one image in GIF file can be modified
at a time. Neither image relative position to screen, nor screen sizes are
modified (use GifPos for that).

Usage:
------

Usage: GifClip [-q] [-i Xmin Ymin Xmax Ymax] [-n n Xmin Ymin Xmax Ymax] [-h]
								GifFile

  If no GifFile is given, GifClip will try to read stdin for GIF file.

Memory required:

Line.


Options:
--------

1. [-q] : quite mode. Default off on MSDOS, on on unix. Controls printout
   of running scan lines. Use -q- to turn off.
2. [-i Xmin Ymin Xmax Ymax] : Clip first image to the dimensions as specified
   by the 4 coordinates (Xmin Ymin Xmax Ymax) of a box clipping region.
     For example: '-i 11 22 33 44' will crop the box from top left [11,22]
   to bottom right [33,44] out of the first image.
     If the first parameter is bigger than third one (Xmin > Xmax) - they are
   swapped. Same for Y.
     Dimensions of cropped image must be confined to original image width and
   height. Note the clipped image include both min & max boundry, and image
   of width W can have coordinates 0 to W-1 (zero based).
     Only one of -i or -n can be specified.
3. [-n n Xmin Ymin Xmax Ymax] : same as -i above but for the nth image:
   '-n 1 11 22 33 44' is exactly the same as the example in -i. Only one of
   -i or -n can be specified.
4. [-h] : print one command line help, similar to Usage above.
