HSMO_OLD.ZIP
************

This is the OLD SOURCE archive of the sources used to generate previous 
HSMODA driver packages containing SERSOFST.TXT compatible serial port 
drivers for Atari and compatible computers. The content was in the folder 
E:\AHSMOD of the harddisk in my Atari ST. As the name says, it contains 
old sources (and some documentation) only. The latest sources (the most 
current ones) are in the HSMO_SRC.ZIP archive, which should be available 
somewhere on http://www.scheutzow.de.

This is free software. The author bears no liability for your use of these 
files. You use it completely at your own risk. There is only one rule the 
author demands to be obeyed: If you publish modifications, new binary 
distributions or even collections of files, you have to make clear that 
you are the publisher, and not the original author.
