(The most important parts translated from German to English on 1994-01-08 
by Harun Scheutzow. I have no time for translating all. If anybody 
translates the remaining parts, I'm very interested in getting the result 
for including it in the next version of this package. My native language 
is German, I think a person whos native language is English would do a 
much better translation. Thanks! (Send only mails smaller than 16kbyte to

These are drivers for the interfaces realized by MFPs (eg IC MC68901 
manufactured by Motorola). They work together with DRVIN.PRG or an 
equivalent replacement. 1_README.TXT contains an introduction.


The general
-----------
Currently all MFP*.PRG have the same configuration possibilities.

The serial part of the MFP, the USART, is not as powerful as the one of 
the SCC. That's why the MFP interfaces are more allergic against high CPU 
load and lose more easy characters.


MFP.PRG
-------
MFP.PRG is made for the so called ST-MFP, which lays from address 
$FFFFFA01 up in every ST, STE, MegaST, MegaSTE, TT, Stacy and STBook. The 
Falcon has this MFP too, but the USART-part is used in an other way (not 
used). MFP.PRG is not for the Falcon. This driver provides the BIOS-device 
6 and the name "MODEM1".


MFP_TT.PRG
----------
MFP_TT.PRG supports the so called TT-MFP form address $FFFFFA81 up, 
contained only in the TT until now. This driver provides the BIOS-device 8 
and the name "SERIAL1".


MFP_FALC.PRG
------------
MFP_FALC.PRG is made for the users who modified their Falcon by drawing 
out the serial interface of the MFP, unused in the original state. The 
driver provides the BIOS-device 6 and the name "MODEM1".

(-- Mail is only in the German part --)


MFP_BAST.PRG
------------
MFP_BAST.PRG is intended for people who soldered a TT-compatible second 
MFP in a non-TT computer. The driver installs itself with the name 
"SERIAL1" and the first empty BIOS device number.

The driver takes this added MFP as a full featured RS232-interface with 
control lines. The control lines are realized as ST-MFP-compatible as 
possible by the GPIP-register. The assignment is as follows:
IO1: DCD, input (as ST-MFP)
IO2: CTS, input (as ST-MFP)
IO3: RTS, output (at ST-MFP realized by PSG)
IO4: DTR, output (at ST-MFP realized by PSG)
IO6: RI,  input (as ST-MFP)



In the following I will describe principal the MFP.PRG:



This is a software speeder and patch for the interface MODEM1 of the Atari 
computer. It removes not only the RTS/CTS-handshake bugs contained in the 
TOS2.06/3.06 too, but increases with its optimized routines the possible 
transfer rate.

Compatibility to HSMODEM1
-------------------------
If MFP.PRG is loaded as the only one or the last driver, all programs 
which run with HSMODEM1 should run with these driver to (on MODEM1).


Suppositions, ...
-----------------
Mag!X
Versions from 2.00 up of these multitask operating system (it is in 
opposite to the current MTOS not only an addition to TOS) have correct 
routines for the serial interfaces. The corresponding GEMDOS-functions 
are absent in version 2.00. The Mag!X-multitasking on an 8MHz-ST during 
38400Bd-receive (eg ZMODEM) is very nice (with a NVDI form Version 2.50 
form 28.10.1993 up): It is possible to work in the foreground with 
keyboard and mouse (eg in a text editor, tested with Everest) while in the 
background the ZMODEM-receive (GSZRZ) runs without any errors. Such 
performance became true by intelligent programming. With Mag!X from 
version 2.00 up the timer interrupt routine modification should be 
switched off because Mag!X has its own nice routines.

These drivers are a replacement for other patches (not only for MODEM1), 
eg RS232ENC or TURBOCTS.

The interface MODEM1 runs without additional hardware with a maximum of 
19200Bd. MFP.PRG can not change this. But it replaces the slow and in part 
buggy routines of the TOS by fast and (I hope) error free ones. With 
additional hardware as the RSVE (developed by me), or as RS-Speed (by 
Stephan Skrodzki) or others baud rates higher than 19200 are provided. 
RSVE allows 38400, 57600 and 115200Bd. MFP.PRG realizes in the range of 
the hardware possibilities (CPU speed, MODEM speed, ...) for a higher 
thruput. The complete documentation of RSVE lays in some mailboxes.

It is impossible to set the MODEM1 only by software to more than 19200Bd 
in the _asynchron_ mode.

Bugs of other programs
----------------------
(-- something untranslated --)


How fast it can run?
--------------------
The problem of the serial transfer with a given speed (measured in Baud) 
is not the transmission of the characters but their reception.
(-- something untranslated --)


57600Bd on 8MHz and 16MHz 68000 CPUs on MODEM1
----------------------------------------------
57600Bd is the magic border of MODEM1 on (Mega)ST(E) which is achieved 
only by small modifications in TOS (or by Mag!X). 115200Bd seem to be 
possible by polling only.

Configuration
-------------
The configuration is done by using SETTER.TTP.

Because the explainations in the drivers are German I added an 
abbreviation.

RSVE:
(Only for users of the RSVE-hardware. Otherwise answer with Nein.) MFP.PRG 
can create the cookie RSVE making the RSVE_SET.PRG unnecessary. The 
function of HISP is done automatically.

HISP:
This setting enables the high baud rates possible with RSVE and RS_Speed 
in the Fcntl-TIOC?BAUD-functions instead of 150/134/110.

REPL:
MFP.PRG can replace baud rates. This is useful only with RSVE or 
RS-Speed if programs can't set 110/134/150Bd and don't know RSVE/RS_Speed.
(-- something untranslated --)
Enter on all six places u if you don't have RSVE or RS-Speed.
(-- something untranslated --)

DTR: (only for MFP.PRG)
The DTR(data terminal ready)-signal is set at the start of this driver on 
time to the value given here. Yes corresponds to on and is equivalent to 
the behavior of TOS, No corresponds to off and prevents most modems from 
going off hook before a communication program has been started.

RBL:
Use 256 as a default. Here the receiver buffer length in byte can be set. 
It may be in the range of 65534 (maximum) to 16 (minimum). Values out of 
this range are set to the default of 256. The water marks are set to 1/4 
(low water mark) and 3/4 (high water mark).

TBL:
As RBL, but for the transmitter buffer length.
