MIDI.PRG
********

This is a SERSOFST.TXT-conform driver for the MIDI-interface. You 
shouldn't use it together with music programs using the MIDI-interface 
because it is intended for file transfer and terminal purposes.

I don't have the time to translate the whole text. If nobody else does it, 
sorry, English-speaking world, you will never got an English version.

This driver installs with the GEMDOS-name "MIDI" and the first empty BIOS 
device number. It is fully interrupt driven. It allows the two baud rates 
possible on the MIDI-port(31250, 7812). It supports "none" and "XON/XOFF" 
handshake. Zmodem usually escapes the XON and XOFF characters that's why 
you can use this handshake with Zmodem. I got transfer rates of 
approximately 3000cps, that means near the physical limit.
