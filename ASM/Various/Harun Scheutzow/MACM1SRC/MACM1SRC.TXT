MACM1SRC.ZIP
************

This is the archive of the latest sources used to generate the MACM1 
driver package containing SERSOFST.TXT compatible serial port drivers for 
the Atari-"Emulator" MagicMac on Apple Macintosh computers. The content 
was in the folder DEVELOP\ inside a folder mapped as drive D: by MagicMac. 
Inside "OLD\" are older sources.

This is free software. The author bears no liability for your use of these 
files. You use it completely at your own risk. There is only one rule the 
author demands to be obeyed: If you publish modifications, new binary 
distributions or even collections of files, you have to make clear that 
you are the publisher, and not the original author.


Why?
----
Years ago I promised to publish the HSMODA sources when I don't maintain 
it any longer. Admittedly, it took some time from non-maintainance to 
publication. If you start new projects, it is simply impossible to keep 
putting time into all old projects, to keep working all old systems you 
worked with.


Workflow and files
------------------
In the distant past I used the GFA assembler 1.5 (*.IS files in a GFA 
private format), but converted nearly all files to plain text *.S and 
adapted the syntax to the GEN.TTP assembler of the Devpack 3.1. The latter 
works under MagiC(Mac) and larger screens without problems, but doesn't 
optimize forward branches and doesn't know symbolic (named) macro 
parameters.

You NEED the HSMO_SRC.ZIP archive to use this archive! Especially the LIB 
directory content is needed, and some instructions might be helpful. The 
*.S assembly source is self contained, and there was no batch to create 
the driver, GEN.TTP from Devpack 3.1 was used directly, but the source can 
easily be integrated into the AHSMOD\CURR\ environment.
