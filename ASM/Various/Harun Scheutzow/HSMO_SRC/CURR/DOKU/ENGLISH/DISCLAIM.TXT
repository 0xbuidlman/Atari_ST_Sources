***A MESSAGE FROM THE TRANSLATOR***

These text files has been translated into English by me with a little 
help from Harry Sideras, and have been thoroughly verified by Peter 
West, and as such, may or may not contain errors (I'd like to think 
that they are fully correct, but as I've never actually studied 
German, I have relied heavily on RufTrade, written and developed by 
Charles Edwards (cedwards@cix.compulink.co.uk) an excellent shareware 
German to English translator program, and my many dictionaries). I 
have tested the instructions to the best of my capabilities and 
knowledge, and I haven't found any errors, and it seems to be okay. 
This English text file should now be kept as part of the main package, 
as directed by the author. I hope it helps you install and use this 
program, and possibly understand it a little better.


***DISCLAIMER***

I make no warranty that the information in these text files will work, 
or that it won't do anything nasty. I accept no responsiblity for any 
damage that may be caused to your system because of any translation 
errors when using this software. The software has been tested as much 
as possible and has been stable on my systems.
