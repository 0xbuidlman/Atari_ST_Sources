Sam-Edit 2  1.8  Beta Release  (18/06/1998)
===========================================

If upon loading Sam-Edit 2 does not recognise any modules, and you are
sure that there should be some then set the modules path using the
program options, and save the options.  Reload and the modules will be
recognised and loaded (memory permitting).  If the modules still do not
load then contact me via email.

(ab)use of the proram is your responsibility and I may not be held
liable in anyway.  Saying this I have not had any problems with the
software myself and do not expect any to occur.
