Hi everybody !

This is a new version of my Falcon protracker replayroutine. This one
is two times faster than the first and there is an accesory as
example. This accesory plays the songs while any programm is running.
At the moment I am writing this text in DEVPAC-editor I'm listening
to an Amiga-song. Perhaps there is a little error in the repeat.
I don't know 'cause I hadn't the chance to compare the routine with
the Amiga 'til now. Also I don't know if the Amiga has a linear or
a logarithmic volumecontrol. If you find errors or have informations
for me, please write us! You can write us for any other reason, too!

The routine plays all ProTracker 1.0C (Amiga) modules and should
work with many others. If a module doesn't run, just resave it
with ProTracker ST (exspecially old modules, 'cause no 15 instrument
modules should run without resaving.) In the futur I will do a
Startrekker and Noisetracker version. Before this you can send not
running modules to us. You can also send any module you have !!!
But the most important of all is: Send money !!! (At least try to)
To your information I am no new member, but everybody said that my
old name (BUG) was shit, so I changed it to CYLAB.

See you soon, and enjoy Falcon !!!                       CYLAB of TPN
