
Hi,

it is now possible to encode & decode ALL executables files!

That means you can pack ACCs, APPs, PRGs, TOSs, TTPs, and they all will
run correctly.

This is the first time a packer can do this (I think so!), even the PFXPAK
cannot decode correctly some kinds of ACCs (e.g. MPlayer!).

I knew that there exist a new version of ATOMIK, the v3.5; maybe I will
improved it too...

But it is always better if the programmer (Salut ALTAIR, ca va bien?) do it
himself!
