Introduction

myscat is a command line tool for merging songs in the MaxYMiser song file
format (.mys files).

It takes two song files as input, and builds a new file with all patterns from
both files, and with a pattern sequence such as the contents of the first song
is played first, and the contents of the second song is played second. Patterns
from both files appear in the same order as in the original files, and patterns
from the second file are renumbered.


How to use myscat

You may run myscat from the command line, or run it without arguments.

If myscat is run without arguments, it assumes the first input song is named
1.mys, and the second is 2.mys. The resulting output file is out.mys.

You may also run myscat by specifying the input files on the command line:

  myscat first.mys second.mys

It will then produce output to the "out.mys" file.

Finally, you can also specify the name of the output file:

  myscat first.mys second.mys output.mys

If no error is displayed, then the conversion is successful.
