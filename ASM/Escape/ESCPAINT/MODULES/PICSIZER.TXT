                    --------------------------------
                             version 1.1
                             

This Escape Paint module can be used to scale pictures in a comfortable way.
You can directly type in the new picture size. The module creates a new
picture with the scaling result. Additionally you can choose beetween
two scaling routines. The first one uses only the colors of the source-
picture for the scaled picture, the second one features something like
interpolation, which creates higher quality pictures. This module is
completely dedicated to viking/mind design. Thanks for your letter!
