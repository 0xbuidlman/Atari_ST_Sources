                               version 1.0
                         
This small Escape Paint module enables you to do lovely swirl-effects with
your pictures. You have to set up two slider which influence the distortion.
Using the first slider you can set an angle increment beetween the circles.
The higher the angle increment the higher is the distortion. The second
slider represents the start angle, which is the angle of the center-circle.
Just try it out! You can simply rotate a picture too by setting up the 
increment to zero and settin the start angle to the wanted angle of the
rotation.

Future implementations:
-interpolation
-speeding up the calculation (the current version is done in C, which is
 really lame!)
-adding new effects
