POEB v1.0 - Peeping Of Eight Bitters


This little piece of software is for all 8 bit fetishists out there.
It brings you a little bit the feeling of working with an 8 bit Atari
when loading something from disk or harddisk. Always when you access to
one of them, you will hear the keyclick several times. Best way to start
POEB is to put it at the beginning of the auto folder, so you have a lot
of clicks already when booting the system ;-).


Requirements:

Any Atari-compatible computer with at least TOS 1.06 should do. POEB only
needs 512 bytes of memory.
