The DOC File!

On this disk you will find :

FULLDEM.PRG   - the demo. This is totally and absolutely 100% PD.
PARTDEM.PRG   - the demo, without the music. ie. the assembled source.
SINTAB.S  - sine table
COSTAB.S  - cosine table
FONTISH.S - character set for the scroller
SCROLL15.S- the demo.

There was an additional file, containing the madmax music. Since I 
didn't  write  the music,  I've removed the source  file  and  the 
references to it in the demo source.  I believe it's ok to use  it 
in the PD demo, but not to distribute the source. Fair enough ?

So  what  exactly  is  SCROLL15  ?   It's  a  single-screen  demo, 
containing :

1) Two logos,  for myself (the dixie flatline) and the other  crew 
member (zaph). These logos work their way through all 512 colours.

2) Three graphic equalisers, showing the volume of the three sound 
channels.

3) Eight different 3d vector objects, twisting in all three axis.

4)  A BIG scroller (64 scanlines high),  which breaks through  the 
bottom screen border.

5) A neat piece of mad max music.

We wrote SCROLL15 over a period of six months,  and it's our first 
demo. In fact, it's the first thing we've ever completed. As such, 
the  code  is HEAVILY commented,  and ideal for  the  novice  demo 
coder.  The problem with most source released is that it's totally 
uncommented and therefore usually illegible.

SCROLL15 was written in DEVPAC 1,  making it ideal to modify using 
the  version given away on various cover disks.  In fact,  we're 
using DEVPAC  1.23,  and  the version given away on the cover
disks was 1.27!

SCROLL15  contains  only one hardware  trick,  the  bottom  border 
buster.  It  also  uses  several  coders  tricks,  eg.  code  that 
generates itself for speed, and code that modifies itself 
for flexibility.

SCROLL15 has been tested on :

1) STFM, 1 meg, version 1 TOS (my machine!)

2) STFM, .5 meg, rainbow TOS (Dave's machine)

3) STE, 4 meg(!), rainbow TOS (Col's machine)

The  only  problems were the bottom border buster was  mildly  STE 
incompatible,  until I used the one by Powerman. Also, I forgot to 
move the stack at first, so Dave's machine blew up. Ho hum.

If you want to use any of the code in your own demos,  feel  free. 
However,  this code isn't ideal for hacking about - eg.  the  line 
drawer,  whilst fast,  won't undraw.  So, you're going to need the 
screen wipe. Which means you'll need the screen flipping probably, 
which means... get the idea?!
Also,  I don't pretend to be anywhere near as good a coder as TLB, 
TCB or ULM,  etc.  No doubt if they see this code, they'll write a 
version which is a tenth the size and quad the speed. Fair enough. 
Jut  remember  this  is our first go,  and we  all  start  at  the 
beginning, so don't laugh too loudly at the code, huh?

SCROLL15  would  not have been the polished(!!) product it  is  today, 
without the help of the following :

1) ST News (6.1 just turned up. Keep going!)

2) Disk Maggie

3) Powerman of TWB, for the dead useful articles in Disk Maggie!

4) Riverdene PDL, for supplying them.

5) Zaph, for sorting out the maths.


If I can dredge up the enthusiasm, and get Zaph off wing commander 
for long enough, there might be a second demo.

THE DIXIE FLATLINE.
