       -O- 128 Byte  Theremin -O-

The 128 byte drum  machine got some nice
feedbacks,   and  at least 4 four of the
guys were  interested  in  doing some YM
stuff themselves.  So heres a follow up!

Usage Hint:
-----------
Click the mouse and move it around.

Features:
---------
 * Full mouse control
 * Fu*k  sine!   128  byte  Theremin has
    bad-ass square wave tone (of course)
 * Buggy source included ;)

Thanks:

C-Rem for testing this heap of crap.


Have fun!
