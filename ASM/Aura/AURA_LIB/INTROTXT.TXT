The routines can used in any PD or Freeware, but not in commercial software
(without asking me).
If you use some routines or parts of it, credit me.
It is only allowed to spread the whole archive (lib, manager and this text).

The PMOD format is a format to make the re-use of written routines much more
easier. The lib includes a little managing tool and examples.

The lib includes routines for polygon calculating, interpolative filling,
ultrafast filling routines for the planemodes, DSP-transformation routines,
colourhandler etc...
If you cannot use them directly, they probably helping you develloping
(better ?) routs. Sadly, the documentations are only german.

These routines are only rudimentary: They are not cutted parts of demos or
something like that, they are basically develloped and included in demos.
So these routines are NO effects, they are low-level routines helping you
build effects much faster. The PMOD format helps you to reuse routines much
faster.

I used the Edison Editor (thats for the "*.lin" files, kick them if you don't
use this editor), the Easy-Assembler 4.0 and the Motorola DSP Assembler. The
sources should be fastly converted to Devpac.

I hope this library is of ANY use to you.
