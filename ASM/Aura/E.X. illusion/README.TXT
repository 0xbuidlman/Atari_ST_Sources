Release Date: 10.6.1995, Release Date of demo: 1.5.1995

It is only allowed to spread this sourcecode in anonymous-ftps, private mail-
boxes (without profits) and of course by copying to your friends. It is per-
mitted to put it in ANY PD-collection or on ANY CD-Rom without asking me !!!
It is allowed to use parts of the source in PD or freeware programms, but not
in commercial programms !
If you use the sourcecodes or modules from the library in your demo or PD-prg,
just credit me.

The sourcecodes from the demo specially are complete, only some lib-functions
were missing in the source. The libfunctions are in PMOD-format, description
and manager are in the "PMOD"-folder.
The documentation of the source is in german (sorry).

The sources could be optimized at some points, I didn't because of lack of
time, less of effort or just lazyness.

As ever: keep cool and stay working !    Jochen Knaus aka BDCannibal, 10.6.95
