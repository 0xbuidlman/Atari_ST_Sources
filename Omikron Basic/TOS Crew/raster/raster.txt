  Mr Ni! of the -crew strikes back. Wow! Nice colors! But let's not brag about it too much and start the story.....Maybe you've read the stories about Mr Ni! coming to this humble Earth, Insh_Allah during his horny holidays and Lord Q evolving into a Mega-Lamer. How sad indeed, we feel sorry for the guy... However there still are two members left of the -crew that should be considered worth talking about.  Yes! applicant-members (Lady SNS) first have to prove they are terribly insane before they granted membership of the -crew. So who's left?!      It's MCP and Chainsaw, two bloodbrothers which have something very particular in common.    As you might have seen, Mr Ni! is quite unspeakable (he made this screen, that should be enough to you and him, but he continued... sigh...), Insh_Allah is terribly freaked out about mosqito's and such but last AND least Lord Q has this specialty of his.... being Mega-Lame. Not the usual lame, not even in a level normally only experienced with people raising chicken and other filth-producing animals. So what's the matter with the two fellows MCP and Chainsaw.  It's disgusting, but I've got to admit it: they're terribly usual. Well, not quite, it's just nobody talks about them (MCP hasn't been reviewed for over a year now, so that should be an indication...). It's so terribly utterly difficult for a scrolltextwriter, you know? Those two fellows are so 'dry', you can't tell anything juicy about them. They don't even have girlfriends (Oh Lord, that should get much too wet!) and they are not even blessed with the luck to enjoy playing with a desoldering-pump. Look here, I don't like to tell about the games Mr Ni! and Lord Q are playing so that's why Insh_Allah had to face publicity about his private life. At least that was the most decent thing to talk about at that time anyway. But these ones, MCP & Chainsaw... sigh... terrible... you can't call them definitely lame, however the younger brother is quite edgy, but... however... well, there's still this problem with MCP: a great programmer (he created the TERA DESKTOP SHELL) but it seems he did never learn to speak a human language: he can understand you, you shoot at him, but he's like a sponge: the water gets inside but it's just like drip.drip.drip coming out. In other words: the longest sentence he's ever said was: "Yes", and he hated it because it one more movement of his mouth extra compared to "No!". Why the Hell can't somebody ask decent questions which cause no trouble if you just mumble something indefinite like "Uhuh" or this other one : "No!". Anything else takes too much effort: it could be optimized to "No!" anyway, so what the fuck do people need all this words for? Computers can do a lot just by issuing 0 and 1, don't they? So why do humans need this bulky overhead of MANY THOUSANDS OF MNEMONICS????????????????    Indeed, crazy!         So far as MCP is concerned, any comment can be "optimized" (he calles it) to a single null-byte. Quite nothing, in fact... Even the comment "bullshit" would take a couple of calories too many.       Now Chainsaw is quite another story, but let me tell you this: he's talking, sometimes he's even talking a lot, but... he's not remarkable in any way. He grows grass on his head (because he's a student and students usually can't pay the barber every half a year), but in no way this is extraordinary. Furthermore he doesn't do anything remarkable too, he doesn't fuck the wrong things, he doesn't code the wrong things (like demo-screens), he even doesn't study the wrong things (like Physics (Lord Q / Mr Ni!) or Mechanical Engineering (Insh_Allah)). No scum anyway. Then what there is to tell about them for Gods Sake?!      Indeed, nothing.     Ah, sorry, I forgot! They do live in a remarkable place: Vroomshoop.    Say what?!    "Vroomshoop"     Local pronouncation: "Vrooms'oop"     They can't help it they got their tongue twised...    Anyway, I'm convinced Dutch people will reach for the map right now, but it's easier to find in the health & social statistics of the Netherlands: In fact, it's a very small village in the Eastpart of the Netherlands and it's quite on the edge. In fact: it's doesn't belong anywhere! The map will tell you it's located in Twente (YES! Tukkers!!!!!! NO GERMANS (they still call them KRAUT)) but the Devil decided it would be located in the Northern part of Twente. Too bad, this is a part, as social statistics will explain, with an avarage IQ not possible to be measured very well due to the VERY LOW LEVEL. The avarage IQ in fact has proven to be lower than the worst possible statistical error. (IQ << 10) (No, NOT a shift-left, asshole!)   Now these folks from "Vrooms'oop" have tried to compensate for this by creating a tremendously, extremely high criminal act rate. Really unbelievable but true! Ofcourse it DOES help statistics if you're a stupid criminal: the police can easily grab you so they just need a little pencil and a piece of paper to note things down. Everyody happy, espcially the CBS (Central Bureau for Social & Financial Statistics)...    To conclude this I'll tell you something that's often told in our part of the country to show how lame some villages can be:      "A traffic-light gets red/A traffic-light gets green/Again an event of the day has been."   Well, if it's not clear to you yet: please do visit this Vrooms'oop, probably you'll like it.       Oh yeah, another saying: "They've GOT cable-T.V. but when do they get a sewer finally?!"      Understood?! Good........ Then this part is finished and Insh_Allah likes to express his great relief it has finished once again.... 
