Building a DSP board, Part Five: Power supply considerations
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the fifth in a series on how I went about building
a dual Motorola DSP56000 sampling board.

There is a lot of hype these days about using separate power
supplies in CD players.  I tend to believe this theory.  Digital
signals are very demanding of power regulators.  I have a feeling
that most power regulators can't react fast enough to prevent
a transient current drain from creating a voltage drop in the
regulator.  This will appear as a little AC signal floating on
top of the power supply voltage.  If this gets into your analog
power supply, it will modulate itself with whatever analog signal
you are processing, causing some distortion.

In my power supply design, I needed a +/- 15V supply (I wanted to use
12V, but my S/H required 15V) and a +/- 5V supply for the analog section
(I consider the 5V needed for my A/D digital part as part of the analog
section) which consists of the analog filters (+/- 15V), the S/H (+/- 15V),
the A/D (+/- 15V and +5V), and the D/A (+/- 5V).  I needed a separate +5V
for the digital section, consisting of the DSP chip, the SRAM, the EPROM,
glue logic, crystal and dividers, and the SM5805.  I didn't have to worry
about nasty digital hash sneaking into my analog supply since all of the
clocking information for the serial A/D is provided by the SM5805, which
runs off of a separate +5V supply.

I added up all the power requirements of each chip, and rounded up generously.
The final design consists of 12.6V five amp center tap (of which I use
one side of the tap for 6.3V) and a four amp 28V center tap (I use
both sides for a bipolar supply).  I rectify the voltage off both
transformers, smooth it out to 8.9V and +/- 19.8V via 22,000 and
4700 uF caps, and put a 3 amp +5V regulator on the former and
the +15V, +5V, -5V, and -15V on appropriate positions on the later.
The digital supply got a 3A fuse and the analog supplies got 1A fuses.
(Make sure you fuse them... I've blown more than one!)  Then, I hooked
the center tap of the analog supply to the ground digital supply for
a common ground.  Oh yeah, don't forget to bypass the regulators with
10 uF tantalum caps to prevent oscillations!

Of course, if you don't like building ugly beasts and want a nice
protected power supply in a nice case, it might be worth the money
(and it is a lot of money) to go buy a 3A/24V bipolar regulated
power supply.
