On the Falcon you should no longer use this trap call. You should use 
XBIOS #$58 - which looks like this:-

    move.w move,-(sp)
    move.w #$58,-(sp)
    trap #14
    addq.l #4,sp
    
Where 'mode' looks like this:-

    bits            meaning
    
    0-2             These bits form a value so that 2^X represents the 
                    number of bits/pixel
    3               80 coloun flag (if set, 80 columns, otherwise 40)
    4               VGA Flag (if set, VGA mode, if not TV/RGB mode) 
    5               PAL Flag (if set, PAL mode, otherwise NTSC)
    6               Overscan Flag (not valid with VGA)
    7               ST compatibility flag
    8               Vertical flag (if set, enables interlace mode on a         
                    colour monitor or double line mode on a VGA monitor)
    9-15            Reserved (set 0)                   


If you're going to be programming on the Falcon, I'd advise you to buy 
'The Atari Compendium' - available from Hisoft - which is a book that 
covers all the new Falcon video, sound and hardware.
