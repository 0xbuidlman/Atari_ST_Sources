nclude "xxxx"	This will replace the include with the file xxxx
		and will treat it as any source assembly file: it will try
		to assemble it.

incbin  "xxxx"	Works just like include except that it will not try to
		assemble it. The whole file will be treated as a dc.x
		directive.

even		it will align the data after it on a longword boundary

CNOP x,y	forces alignment, (y=2^n). EVEN==CNOP 0,2

xdef		it will define a symbol ( in the hunk_ext $000003ef hunk )
		see \doc\amiga.txt



SECTION name	defines a section
BSS		data section

end		It is used to indicate the end of a section/of a symbol

XREF name	this one is just added for completeness, you needn't include it.
		on the amiga it allows you to reference XDEF symbols. As XDEF 		allows
you to declare labels as external (if you like), so that 		other object
files can reference them with XREF.

dc.x		It will reserve a small data area: dc.b 0  will be
		traduced by the assembler by $00, dc.w $ffff will be
		traduced by $ffff...

ds.x yyy	Declares yyy x's

DCB.x n,v          declares n x's of value v

macro/endm	It allows the user to define newer macros
		For example, the macro moov:

		moov    MACRO
			move.\0 \1,\2
			ENDM

		the macro call

			moov.l  d0,d1

		would be expanded as

			move.l  d0,d1

< ... >		used to send an entire statement as a macro parameter

name EQU val	it allows the user to define constants
or =		for example, lcd_mem    equ  $00000000
		This means that all reference done to lcd_mem in the code
		will be replaced by a zero

name EQUR reg	allows name to be used to represent reg

name SET val	allows variables to be defined, in that the value can
		change in the program

IFxx VALUE	parse block if tst VALUE meets conition (xx):
		EQ   : equal
		NE   : non equal
		GE   : greater
		LT   : less than
		LE   : lower or equal
		C    : carry
		NC   : no carry
		parse block if symbol VALUE is:
		D    :  defined
		ND   : not defined

ENDC		ending block for ifxx
ENDIF		alternative for ENDC

/* extra stuff again */

\LABEL		local label
\xx@xx		LABEL local enumeration label, for use in MACROs (xx & yy part 		of
label name)
