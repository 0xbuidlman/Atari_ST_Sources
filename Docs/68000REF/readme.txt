Motorola 68000 Instruction Set.     Revision 2.1                22 May, 1994
------------------------------------------------

Here is a 3 page reference guide for the Motorola 68000 Instruction Set.
It might be useful especially for beginning assembler programmers.

The instructions are listed alphabetically showing the op-codes, description,
the assembler syntax, data size and the condition flags affected. A small
reminder on how the CMP (compare) instruction works is included as are
the addressing modes of the 68000.

As shown at the end of the document the details were gathered from the
book called "Programming the 68000" by Steve Williams. The section on
comparisons was from an article which appeared in BYTE Magazine.

The default page length for the pages is 66 lines per page. Of course you
may use your favourite text editor or word processor to format the document
to your tastes.

This document is strictly for personal use only. 

I hope other assembler programmers might find this quick reference guide
helpful in their endeavours to master Motorola 68000 assembly programming. :)
