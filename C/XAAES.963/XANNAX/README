It is the program XaNNaX

XaAES <---- N.Aes seA.N <---- SEAaX
--          -         -          --

Switch autofolder and mintfolder easy by drag&drop

Nowadays harddiscs are so large, that for many of you there is no objection
against having major parts of operating environment duplicated.

This contemplation is the basis of XaNNaX

You basically have 3 autofolders and 3 mint folders
Every folder is supposed to have everything you need to run the 3
different Aes's and the different MiNT environment you might want.

This includes the CPX's and accessories xdd's xfs's and mint.cnf

So you must configure your control panel to use c:\auto\cpx\

You must set
accpath c:\auto\acc\ for XaAES in XA_SETUP.SCL
and
export ACCPATH=c:\auto\acc\ for N.Aes in N_AES.CNF

For TOS I fear you must have the set of ACC's in the root of C:\

The XaNNaX folder contains skeleton folders for this purpose.
You must fill them out yourself.

XaNNaX uses the existence and contents of the auto folders to determine its
validity (and to know what it should be in the inactive state)

As you might see, I have set them to the state in which XaAES is active.


Set XaNNaX.ttp on your desktop
drop the autofolder you want to use on the icon and everything will be
switched.


Example:
Current state: for use of XaAES
auto
auto.na
auto.to
mint
mint.na
mint.to

After dropping auto.na on XaNNaX:

new state
auto.xa
auto
auto.to
mint.xa
mint
mint.to

Reboot and you will see that your system will now run N.Aes
A similar action applies to dragging auto.to on XaNNaX
mint.to is only there to provide symmetry.

Have fun!
