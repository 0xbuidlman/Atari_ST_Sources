  FONT_RING (-456; 4 LONGs)  
  This area contains three pointers and a NULL. The first two 
  pointers point to linked lists of system font headers. The 
  third pointer points to the linked list of GDOS based fonts.

  FONT_COUNT (-440; WORD)  
  Total number of fonts pointed to by the FONT_RING pointers.  

I understand that this actually means:

  struct font_rings {
    struct font_head *first_list;
    struct font_head *second_list;
    struct font_head *bdos_list;
    void * null_list;
  };

translated from "le livre du développeur" (the developper handbook):

  FONT_RING is an array of four pointers, each of which points to
  a list of font headers linked together to form a string.
  the first entry designates the list of system fonts.
  the second and third serve for extensions.
  The fourth entry terminates the string, and must always equal zero.
  
  When VDI is looking for a font, it begins with the first entry
  in FONT_RING, and searches all fonts reached by this list.
  Once this list is over, both extension lists are examined.
  the null value in the fourth entry ends the search.
  
  The first two entries indicate resident fonts [font that stay in
  memory]; the third one is used by GDOS. When the VDI looks for
  a font with a given size and type, the lists are examined until
  the first font with the right type is found. The VDI then keeps
  looking to find, for this type, a font having also the specified
  size. The search ends either when a font of different type is
  encountered, or when the FONT_RING null entry is reached.
  
  In order to ensure that the VDI find the fonts looked for, 
  the fonts of same type must be linked in growing point size.
  
  If the user wants to add additional fonts, FONT_RING[0] shall
  be set to point to this font list; the last pointer in the
  new list shall point to the original contents of FONT_RING[0].
