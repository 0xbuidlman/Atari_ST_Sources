*** The Story
  In the future, one of the most popular sports is -+* The Maze *+-
  Here you enter a Big maze, into a self-built (or bought) Vehicle, The maze has 
  No gravity so all your vehicle need is some propultion, and ofcourse Weapons.
  
  this is where the story behind it all is going to be :)
  
*** The Ideas behind -+* The Maze *+-
 The main idea, was firts to make a new version of Midimaze, one that used some 
 of the added posibilities of the Falcon computer.. However, after the first 
 idea was born,. it has been added to and changed so that ,even if the main idea 
 is still Midimaze, it has grown out beyond the simple midimaze idea.
 the first added possibility was that I would use complete 3D instead of only a 
 3D-look, ie instead of beeing able to stear only Right Left, you will now have 
 free controll, ie Right/Left/Up/Down, and also Roll Right/Left.
 The next part that was changed was that there will be more game-modes, in 
 Midimaze all you could do was shoot the enemie, and get scores) in 
 -+* The  Maze *+- there will also be single-player options, and so called Catch 
 The flag  (CTF) options. The next thing that was added was so called Powerups!, 
 ie you will in the game find things that will for a time beeing make your craft 
 better then the others (unless they have powerups, OR have really good crafts)
 After this I have added more things, and all of them are decribed below, but as 
 you see this is not just an Midimaze 2000, but this is -+* The Maze *+-

 
*** "Facts"

- Up to 6 players by using midi-ring.
- 2 players against each others via null-modem.
- Up to 6 teams.
- Each computer handles 3 computer players.
  - 2 computers give then 2 human players, and 6 computer players, these can 
    then be grouped in different teams, etc
- The ability to "buy" complete crafts, or "build" your own
- Plenty of built crafts to choose from.
- Plenty of different parts to choose
- Extremely module-built for ease of upgrading...
  Different kind of modules.
  - Weapon,Ships
  - Graphics
  - Sound
  - Enemies (AI, etc)
  - Maps
  - Game-logic (ctf,deathmatch,etc)
  - All these modules can be grouped together...


*** Module System
- Every module has its own "name-tag"
- Before a "campaign" is to be started, the connected computers communicate to 
  find out what modules are missing on which cmoputers, the computers that have 
  missing modules then ask the user if it is OK to load them from some other 
  computer. IF it is not allowed to load it, the game will either NOT use the 
  modules on any computer, OR the game will not be established, since it 
  requires the moduels to run, IE if you want to play an CTF-game, buit there 
  exist no ctf-module on one computer, the game will not be able to start
