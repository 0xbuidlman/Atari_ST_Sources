NAME
	lp.dev - MagiC/STinG network printer device driver


SYNOPSIS
	-


DESCRIPTION

Lp.dev can only be used with the MagiC TOS compatible operating system on 
an ST/TT/Falcon or compatible machine. It installs another device driver 
that can be accessed as u:\dev\lp.

Printer drivers from TOS/GEM applications or GDOS printer drivers can 
transparently print over the network on a remote printer by redirecting 
the print output to the file "u:\dev\lp".

Lp.dev uses a remote spooling daemon to print the information that
was written to the device it provides.

Lp.dev captures information written to this device in a temporary spool
file. Once the stream is closed the temporary file gets transmitted to the
remote host using the lpr/lpd protocol as described in RFC1179.

Lp.dev has no configuration options.

Lp.dev shall be copied to the directory where MagiC expects to find device
driver executables at boot time e.g. \gemsys\magic\xtension


ENVIRONMENT

Lpr.prg does not use any environment variables.


FILES

Lp.dev uses the same STinG variables from default.cfg as lpr.prg.
However you *must* have an entry LPn_QN = lp present as there is currently 
no way to specify a different local printer queue than lp. n can be 
anything from 1 to 9 though.

DIAGNOSTICS

Lp.dev implicitly conveys formatting option -l (raw, binary) to the
printing server. No other formatting can be chosen. This is intended to
pass on binary data to the remote printer, i.e. printer data already
formatted for a specific printer by e.g. GDOS.

All limitations found in lpr.prg also apply to lp.dev.
