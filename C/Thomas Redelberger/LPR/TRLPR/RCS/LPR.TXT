User manual for Thomas' lpr remote printing clients and server package.


Introduction

Peter Rottengatter's STinG TCP/IP stack for Atari ST/TT/Falcon machines and
compatibles (denoted ST for short below) provides internet access but also
aims for a complete TCP/IP network solution. One useful feature of
networked computers is the ability to share printer hardware. This package
provides client and server software for STs to access remote printers on
STs or other machines. As the software is compliant with RFC1179
interoperability is ensured. Although the software resembles the BSD
printing system that is often used on other operating systems like Linux,
it uses the features of GEM-AES and STinG for easy installation and
operation under both single tasking TOS and multitasking OS.


Prerequisites

I assume that you have built a STinG TCP/IP network of one or more STs
and/or any other networked machines. This package is of no use for you if
you just use STinG to access the internet via a provider.

It does not matter if the machines are networked via the serial port, midi
port, ethernet, what ever.

Your STs may run a single or multitasking OS. Additional support is
provided for MagiC.

In order to print from an application running on an ST you must be able to
generate a file instead of sending the output directly to the printer. The
TRLPR package is currently known to be useful with the following
applications:

That's Write 3.11 PS
Papyrus 7.58a
Texel 2.00
Arabesque 2 V1.2
Xact 3.10h
Phoenix 5.0

In particular if you use NVDI (version >= 4) as GDOS, you win as the NVDI
printer drivers can print to a file. Thus any application that supports
printing via GDOS can print remotely.


Installation

Unpack the archive TRLPRxxx.LZH to any directory you like using LHARC or
similar.
The following installation steps depend on your configuration. The
instructions below cover typical usage examples. For reference information
about the individual TRLPR components see the files *-MAN.TXT.


Example 1)

Your ST is linked to a network with a Linux server.

First make sure STinG is up and running on your ST and you can ping the
server.

You have to have an user account on the server, the username be e.g.
"thomas".

Edit the file /etc/hosts.lpd. The host name of the ST must be added to this
file such that the ST is allowed to access the printer server. In this
example the ST shall have the name "thomas2"


Edit the file DEFAULT.CFG the STinG installation uses on the ST with a text
editor.

Add the following lines to DEFAULT.CFG (USERNAME and HOSTNAME may already
be present but void):
#
USERNAME = thomas
HOSTNAME = thomas2
#
LPA_QN = lp
LPA_RM = thomas1
LPA_SD = C:\TMP
#

This assumes there exists a printer queue on thomas1 with the name "lp".

thomas1 is the hostname of the remote Linux server. STinG must be able to resolve
this to a valid IP address. Hence in this case thomas1 needs to be associated
to the servers IP address using the STinG resolver module. You may however
use plain ip addresses for LPA_RM.

The entry LPA_SD must specify an existing directory on the ST where to put
temporary files.

Reboot the ST


Example 1a)

Everything else like above but you wanted to print to a different queue on
the Linux box e.g. with name "HP4" you would edit DEFAULT.CFG like this:
#
USERNAME = thomas
HOSTNAME = thomas2
#
LPA_QN = lp
LPA_RP = HP4
LPA_RM = thomas1
LPA_SD = C:\TMP
#


Example 2)

You have linked just two ST machines. You have physically connected a
printer to ST#2 on the parallel printer port. You run single TOS on ST#2.
ST#2 shall act as a printer server. You want to print from ST#1.

First make sure STinG runs well on both machines and you can ping in both
directions. Also alias names like thomas1 and thomas2 you gave to both
machines are resolved when you ping from both sides.

Configure ST#1 like the ST in example 1) above.

Edit the file DEFAULT.CFG you STinG installation uses on ST#2 with a text
editor.

Make sure you have the following lines in DEFAULT.CFG:
#
LPA_QN = lp
LPA_LP = PRN:
LPA_SD = C:\TMP
#

The last entry must specify an existing directory on ST#2 where to put
temporary files.

Copy lpd.prg to the root directory of the boot drive of ST#2 and rename it
lpd.acc.

Reboot ST#2

When ST#2 comes up again do not worry that lpd.acc does not show up as a
desk accessory in the menu. It need not as it has no user interface.

At ST#1 configure your desktop such that you may drop files on lpr.prg.


How to Print

When you generated a file to be printed you simply drop this file on
lpr.prg. lpr.prg starts and takes the file as an argument. It sends the
file to the remote printer spooler daemon. If everything tuns smoothly it
keeps quiet. It shows a dialog box only in case of error to indicate the
cause.
Note that this is not possible with the desktop of older single TOSes. Here
you could work around by giving the file a special extension and configure
the desktop such that lpr.prg is launched once the file is double clicked.


MagiC Support

If you run the MagiC TOS compatible operating system you may
also install the device driver lp.dev :

-       Copy lp.dev to the location indicated in you MagiC manual. E.g.
        C:\GEMSYS\MAGIC\XTENSION

-       Make sure you have added settings to the file DEFAULT.CFG
        like in example 1).

-       Reboot. You should see now a new device called  lp  in the
        directory u:\dev

-       Test the device driver by copying a small file to u:\dev\lp .
        Example using the Mupfel shell:
                cp anyfile u:\dev\lp

        Note that MagXDesk will not allow you to drop a file on u:\dev\lp
        to trigger a copy. So printing from the desktop MagXDesk still
        requires use of lpr.prg (see below).

-       Redirect GDOS/NVDI printing to the "file" u:\dev\lp . This can be
        effected by modifying the output file in the NVDI printer device
        CPX as described in the NVDI manual.

-       Printing from an application that uses GDOS to print will now go
        right away over the network to the remote printer.


The Queue Concept

The lpr package centres around the concept of printer "queues".

There are queues defined on the server. When you add lines to DEFAULT.CFG
like in Example 2) to be used by lpd.prg, you define a queue and associate
it with a physical printer.

Additional queues differ in the third character of the DEFAULT.CFG
variables:

LPA_QN = ...    first queue
LPA_LP = ...
LPA_SD = ...
#
LPB_QN = ...    second queue
LPB_LP = ...
LPB_SD = ...
#
LPC_QN = ...    third queue
LPC_LP = ...
LPC_SD = ...

Hence 26 queues may be defined. Note that you can refer to the same
physical printer with more than one queue (with a different queue name
LPx_QN though).

Similarly you define printer queues on each client machine. These may also
be up to 26. For a client queue you also specify a mapping between local
queues and remote queues. Example DEFAULT.CFG:
#
LPA_QN = lp
LPA_RP = the_hp
LPA_RM = thomas1
LPA_SD = C:\TMP #

The line LPA_RP = the_hp associates the *remote queue* the_hp on machine
thomas1 with the local queue lp (as defined by LPA_QN = lp).
If LPx_RP is missing the name for the remote queue defaults to the name 
for the local queue.

This mechanism may seem complicated at first but provides necessary
flexibility.
E.g.: with this release lp.dev always looks for the local queue lp and you
need LPx_RP to address a remote queue with a different name.
Similarly lpr.prg also looks for the local queue lp by default. Other
queues may be chosen by a command line option for lpr.prg however.

With a Linux remote server you usually reach one and the same printer by
different queue names but achieve different processing (filtering) on the
data before they reach the printer. This is supported by this package. The
lpd.prg daemon for STs supplied with this package however does not (yet)
have such filtering capability.



Limitations


I developed and tested lpr with the following configuration:

-        STinG v 1.12 running SLIP via Modem1 on an 4MB 260ST under MagiC
         5.11

-        STinG v 1.20 running my own ethernet driver on a custom built
         NE2000 adapter on an 4MB 260ST under MagiC 5.11 and TOS 1.04

-        Lpd running on a PC under OS/2 Warp 4 with built-in TCP/IP

-        Lpd running on a PC under SuSE Linux 5.3

-        HP Deskjet 690C connected to the PC

I welcome any notice on which platforms it does run.
I do not welcome any notice on which platforms it does not run ;-) .

lpr.prg and lp.dev comply with RFC1179. The main limitation is missing
input filtering.

lpd.prg supports a subset of RFC1179 enabling printing only. Queue queries
and other operations are not yet supported.


How to use MagXDesk's printer icon

If lpr is working well from the command line or by drag and drop, you may
want to replace print.ttp from MagiC's MagXDesk with lpr.prg in MagiC's
configuration:
Optionen, Einstellungen..., Dienstprogramme, Ausgabe: c:\bin\lpr.prg

Thus you can print files by drag and drop on MAGXDESK's printer icon.
Similar results can be obtained with other shells.


Choosing the correct NVDI printer device driver

When using NVDI or similar software you can easily redirect GDOS
printing to a file. If no filtering on the remote host is active you need
to "print" to a file using a GDOS printer driver for the *same printer 
model* that is attached as the remote printer.


Where to Complain About the Queue Model

The queue concept of this lpr package and the command line options of
lpr.prg are similar to the BSD lpr package in widespread use under Linux.


Other Ways to Run lpd.prg

Copy lpd.prg to a directory where it gets automatically started at system
start. Example: for MagiC this is like C:\GEMSYS\MAGIC\START


Print Job Filtering on Linux Servers

If you do want a filtering happen, for example you send an ASCII file with
lpr and the remote host should convert to Postscript before print, you need
to configure the lp-daemon (lpd) at the remote host. A good description of
this can be found in the Linux documentation or the periodical c't 17/98
page 190. lpd.prg currently does not support filtering.


LPD and LPR on the same ST?

You may run lpr.prg/lp.dev and lpd.prg/lpd.acc on the same machine thus 
using the machine as an lpr server and client the same time.
Although this does look like overkill it may be useful for testing.

Say you have following lines in DEFAULT.CFG to operate lpd.prg:
#
LPA_QN = lp
LPA_LP = PRN:
LPA_SD = C:\TMP
#

If you run lpr.prg it will look for but not find an LPA_RM. However the
remote machine defaults to 127.0.0.1. Ans the remote queue defaults to the
name of the local queue. Thus you can still reach this printer from lpr.prg
as the printer lp (which is the default for lpr.prg as well).

Provided STinG is running and you can ping the remote machine you need to do 
the following to run lpr.ttp :
a162 1
-	Make sure the lpd spooling daemon is running on the remote host
d164 1
a164 6
-	Insert a variable PRINTHOST in STinG's default.cnf file. 
	PRINTHOST may be something like blahost.anydomain or a dotted quad 
	like 192.168.1.1 for example. See sting.hyp for help on default.cnf.
	I propose to put PRINTHOST at the end of default.cnf where it says: 
	here starts the client stuff and you may want to add a comment 
	"Used by TRlpr:"
d166 2
a167 3
-	Make sure you have the variables USERNAME and HOSTNAME set in your 
	default.cnf. You may use environment variables as well; 
	see lpr-man.txt
d169 2
a170 3
-	Set the environment variable PRINTER to the name of the printer 
	(a queue to be precise) on the remote host or use the command line 
	option -Pprinter.
d172 2
a173 2
-	Copy lpr.ttp to a place where you keep executable utilities and
	that is in your path for convenience.

If you run the MagiC TOS compatible operating system you may in addition also 
install the device driver lp.dev :
d182 3
a184 2
-	Copy lp.dev to the location indicated in you MagiC manual. E.G.
	C:\GEMSYS\MAGIC\XTENSION
d186 3
a188 4
-	Make shure you have set the environment and/or default.cnf variables
	mentioned above in such a way that you can use lpr.ttp *without* further
	command line options.
	This is vital because lp.dev relies on the same settings.
d190 2
a191 2
-	Do a reboot. You should see now a new device called  lp  in the directory
	u:\dev
a192 4
-	Test the device driver by copying a small file (that you would normally
	supply to lpr.ttp) to u:\dev\lp . Example using the Mupfel shell:
	  cp anyfile u:\dev\lp
	If that prints well...
d194 1
a194 5
-	Redirect GDOS/NVDI printing to the "file" u:\dev\lp . This can be effected
	by modifying the output file in the NVDI printer device CPX as decribed in the
	NVDI manual.
	Whether this redirection also works for methods that print without GDOS/NVDI
	has yet to be tested.
d196 1
a196 2
-	Printing from an application that uses GDOS should now go right away over the
	network to the remote printer.

If lpr is working well from the command line, you may want replace print.ttp 
from MagiC with lpr.ttp in MagiC's configuration. Thus you can print files 
by drag and drop on MAGXDESK's printer icon. Similar results can be obtained 
with other shells.

When using NVDI (as I do) or similar software you can easily redirect GDOS 
printing to a file. If no filtering on the remote host is active you need to 
print through the *same type* of GDOS printer to a file that you later 
submit the *same type* of remote printer.

As I added now the device driver lp.dev to this package you may now print
directly to the "file" u:\dev\lp without the need to create an intermediate
file.


As far as I know there are two ways to print from GEMDOS:
- Open, write and close the PRN device
- Writing to PRN with Cprnout
Another way is Bconout to PRN from the BIOS.
The latter two require a semiautomatic capturing because you do not know 
when printing is finished. I know of old programs to do this but I am unsure 
if they work properly under MagiC.
For the first way the issue is if and how a redirection from PRN to u:\dev\lp
can be done.
I would be grateful if somebody gave me advice on this issues.

If you do want a filtering happen, for example you send an ASCII file with 
lpr and the remote host should convert to Postscript before print, you need 
to configure the lp-daemon (lpd) at the remote host. A good description of 
this can be found in the Linux documentation or the periodical c't 17/98
