@NAME
	lp.dev - MagiC/STinG network printer device driver


SYNOPSIS
	-


DESCRIPTION

Lp.dev can *only* be used with the MagiC TOS compatible operating system. 
It installs another device driver that can be accessed as u:\dev\lp.

Printer drivers from TOS applications or GDOS printer drivers can 
transparently print over the network on a remote printer by redirecting 
the print output to the file "u:\dev\lp".

Lp.dev uses a remote spooling daemon to print the information that
was written to the device is provides.

Lp.dev captures information written to this device in a temporary spool
file. Once the stream is closed the temporary file gets transmitted to the
remote host using the lpr/lpd protocol as described in RFC1179.

Lp.dev has no configuration options.

Lp.dev shall be copied to the directory where MagiC expects to find device
driver executables at boot time e.g. \gemsys\magic\xtension


ENVIRONMENT

Lpr.prg does not use any environment variables.


FILES

Lp.dev uses the same STinG variables from default.cfg as lpr.prg.
However you *must* have an entry LPx_QN = lp present as there is currently 
no way to specify a different printer.


SEE ALSO

lpr-man.txt, lpd-man.txt


HISTORY

See lpr-man.txt


DIAGNOSTICS

Only formatting option -l (raw, binary ) is supported. This is intended to
pass on binary data to the remote printer, i.e. printer data already
formatted for a specific printer by e.g. GDOS.

All limitations found in lpr.prg also apply to lp.dev.

Lp.dev uses a local or remote spooling daemon to print the named files when facilities 
become available. 
Lp.dev captures information written to this device in a temporary file. Once the stream
is closed the temporary file gets transmitted to the remote host using the lpr/lpd
protocol as described in RFC1179.

ENVIRONMENT

a25 2
The following environment variables (or variables in default.cnf see below) have to exist
as they are used by lp.dev:
d27 2
a28 1
PRINTER		Specifies the remote printer (queue)
a29 1
USER		Specifies the user name
d31 1
a31 3
HOST		Specifies the name of the local host

PRINTHOST	Specifies the name of the remote host
d33 1
a33 3
TMPDIR		Specifies a path to store the temporary file
TEMP		Ditto
TMP		Ditto, if you got any of the three you are fine
d38 3
a40 1
The following file is consulted by lp.dev:
a41 4
default.cnf in the STinG directory
	Variables USERNAME, HOSTNAME, and PRINTHOST are read to specify 
	user name, name of the local host and name of the remote host. 
	Environment variables take precedence over variables in default.cnf.

The lpr command appeared in 3BSD.

Only formatting option -l (raw, binary ) is supported. This is intended to pass
on binary data to the remote printer, i.e. printer data already formatted for a 
specific printer by e.g. GDOS.

Lp.dev does not use a printcap file. Thus lp.dev can not do any processing 
(filtering) to its input.

Currently lp.dev does not remove the temporary file from the local system after
printing.

Lp.dev consults environment strings and default.cnf only once the first time
it gets used. If you change something there you need to reboot.@
