For STIKCOVL:

OK, here's the source release, as I'm not doing anything with it. If you will
then please e-mail at drz@cybercomm.net. The main reason is that this way
there won't be ten people working on the exact same thing. If you have
questions you can mail me also.
All this stuff was compiled with Pure C, you may need to make some
modifications for your particular compiler. I apologize for a lack of
comments. All this stuff falls under the Gnu General Public License version
2 or higher, of which I've included a copy for you to read.
