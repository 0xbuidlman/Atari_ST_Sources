<h1>Full NewsGroups Help</h1>
<P>The Full NewsGroups window contains a complete list of all NewsGroups available from your News Server.  Because this file can be very large, it may take several minutes to fetch it.  The same selection and subscription ability exists for this window as for the New NewsGroups window.  An attempt to sort this file will be made.  If you have enough memory, the sort will take place.  This will also remove extraneous information from the FULLGRP.TXT file (thus reducing its size) and will create a FULLGRP.IDX file, which is used to reduce the time, required to scroll through the file.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
