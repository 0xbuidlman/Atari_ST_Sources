<H1>Article Text Help</H1>
<P>The Article Text window displays a News Article. The article contains a header and the message body. The header contains lines such as: Author, Subject, Date, etc. The body contains the message response entered by the author. Each article read is available on your local disk as 'NNNNNN.TXT', where NNNNN is the Article number. You can delete these files as you choose by pressing the Del key within the window. This provides a method to keep un-wanted messages from accumulating.</P>
