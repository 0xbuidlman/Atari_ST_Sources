	ASCII format text converter by Seb/The REMOVERS
	
	
It's just a lame part of code to translate some ASCII text from a format 
to another ( it does quite the same thing as EXCHANGE !! ) but here is the
routin in ASM to be used with C, Pascal or GFA ... 
It was coded with ASSEMBLE in less than ten minutes !!!
I may have made a mistake : indeed I'm not sure but I believe that the first
128 characters are all the same in each ASCII format so I don't convert them.
However, it's not very difficult to change this !!!

It was originally coded to give it to the author of Newsie ( John Rojewski ) 
so that he includes that in his wonderful News/Mail/FTP reader !!!

Spread it all where you can !!!
