<h1>Article Overview Help</h1>
<P>For any given NewsGroup, selecting that NewsGroup via a double-click or Return Key in the Subscribed NewsGroup window will fetch the Article Overview list from the News Server.  This list is displayed in the Article Overview window.  The overviews are formatted with: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Article number</LI>
<LI>Subject</LI>
<LI>Author</LI>
<LI>Date of submission</LI>
<LI>Number of lines of message text</LI>
</UL>

<P>Any of the overviews can be selected via mouse click or keyboard up and down arrow keys.  When selected, the article line is displayed in the color RED.  For Monochrome users (ST-High), the selected article will be underlined.</P>
<P>Article Threads are recognized.  Threads are a group of related articles, and are marked with a '+' for the primary article, and '-' for subordinate articles.  Thread formatting is dependent upon the Newsreading Preferences 'Create Threads' and 'Collapse Threads'.  If 'Create Threads' is un-selected, then Thread processing is bypassed and articles are shown in numeric (ascending) order.  If 'Create Threads' alone is selected, both the primary ('+') articles and subordinate ('-') articles will be displayed.  If the 'Collapse Threads' option is selected, only the primary ('+') articles will be displayed.</P>
