<H1>New NewsGroups Help</H1>
<P>The New NewsGroups window displays a list of NewsGroups created after a certain Date and Time. The data and time are entered by the user in a dialog. This list can be referenced and any of the NewsGroup names can be selected, and subscribed to.</P>
<P>When the Subscribe is performed, the NewsGroup name is added to the Subscribed NewsGroup window, and is immediately available for use. A double-click with the left mouse button, or selecting Subscribe from the Special menu performs the Subscribe function.</P>
<P>If you have enough memory, a sort will take place. This will also remove extraneous information from the NEWGRP.TXT file (thus reducing its size) and will create a NEWGRP.IDX file, which is used to reduce the time required to scroll through the file.</P>
