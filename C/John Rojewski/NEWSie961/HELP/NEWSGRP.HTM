<H1>Subscribed NewsGroups Help</H1>
<P></P>
<P>The Subscribed NewsGroups window displays the NewsGroups that you have selected to be kept aware of new articles. A NewsGroup is a category of messages that (should) relate to some topic.</P>
<P>There are many thousands of NewsGroups, and not all News Servers (ISPs) offer all NewsGroups. You may manually enter the name of a NewsGroup you are interested in viewing, or in combination with the Full NewsGroup and New NewsGroup windows, Subscribe to additional NewsGroups.</P>
<P>If your ISP does not support a particular newsgroup in the Subscribed NewsGroups list, it will be marked with a '?' in the first column of the display. You may select such a group, but the only action that may be performed is to UnSubscribe.</P>
