1. Information about FireText.
1.1. The Function of the Program.

    The Function of this Program is to let the user of the program to
be able to convert text-files into messages that the Normal Atari mail
software can handle (LED, JETMAIL, IOS, m.m) Normally this can be done
in the message editor, but this program do much more than just
converts the text-files.
    It can convert the text-files on an special date (For instance on
someones Birthday) So that the user does not have to remember to write
that message on that day.
    It can also convert text-files on a periodic basis, like Every
month (this is idealistic for Moderators, since they do not have to
remember to post the rules, they only tell this program what to do.


1.2 The concept of Keyware

    What is Key-ware? Well Normally it is that the program is freely
distributed, BUT to be able to fully use the program you will have to
register the program and get a key. Normally this registration cost
the user some money, but with FireText YOU do not have to pay
anything, All you have to do is send me an NETMAIL to one of my
adresses, and you will shortly after that recieve the key.


1.3 Registration of FireText.

    So How do you register? Well send me an NETmail to one of the
    following adresses:
    2:203/611.5@fidonet.org
    7:100/105@fujinet.ftn
    51:1102/201@atarinet.ftn
    79:100/105@saknet.ftn
    90:1103/105@nest.ftn
    I would Like that you send me the following data:
    Name
    BBS/Node/Point-name
    Country
    An Network adress (Preferably fidonet, fujinet,saknet,atarinet or
    nest)

2. The Command-line Commands.
2.1

2.2 Commands.
    -Process   This will make FireText process the config-file and
               look if ther is some file that needs to be converted.
    -Silent    This Command will only work when using the -Process
               command.
               This will turn of any gem-processing under processing
               that FireText will use, Meaning No menu, No windows, No
               dialogs, and No Alert-boxes. If there is some errors
               you will find the result in the logfile-only.
    -Quit      This Command will only work when using the -Process
               command, and it will make FireText quit after
               processing the config-file.



3. The Script System



4. The Text-files.
    There are many commands that can be used in the text-files that are
to be converted, These commands are mainly to be used for files that
are to be converted into an message frequently like file-listings, or
rules, and things like that. Ofcourse this could also be used in the
configfile, BUT I thought that it migth be apreciated if I included
this to.
Some of these commands is for telling in which area the file is to be 
converted, and from whom, etc. These Commands HAVE to be placed first, 
else FireTEXT will believe it is a part of the text.
These 4 Commands that have to be placed at the beginning is
AREA: x     - In which Area the Message is to be written.
FROM: x     - From which Person.
SUBJECT: x  - With the subject.
TO: x       - To this Person.

the Other commands is a part that can be used everywhere in the text.
any of these commands will begin with the "!" Character.
If an unknown command is found it will be ignored.

!!       the ! character.
!Version the Version of Firetext.
!Date    Todays date in the following format YYMMDD.
!Day     The day in month (DD).
!Month   The Month of the Year (MM).
!Year    The Year (YY).
!Fyear   The Full Year (YYYY).
!Time    The time in the following Format HH:MM:SS.
!Hour    The Hour of the Day (HH).
!Minute  The minute in the Hour (MM).
!Second  The second in the Minute (SS).
!From    Is the same as in the From-header part, ie the From-name.
!To      Is the same as in the To-header part, ie the To-name.
