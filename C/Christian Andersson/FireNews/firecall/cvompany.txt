Christian Andersson barked in A.ATARI.TELECOM on 24 Mar 96:

 CA> How does your phone-company handle the user-part of the Caller id

It's an extra-cost item, and US West handles it VERY badly.  I was so 
dissatisfied with the service that I cancelled it.

 CA> Do you have to pay to get this service? And How much does it cost?
 CA> is there any ways of cancelling this service when you have it on?

It costs an extra $6.95/month, it can be cancelled (and has been), AND the 
telco will also allow users to BLOCK the CID service, so that when they call 
someone who has CID enabled, they show up as either "anonymous" or "information 
not available."  They charge extra for a permanent "anonymous" flag, too, and 
as far as I am concerned, they're defrauding CID subscribers by selling them a 
service and then selling a means of circumventing that service to other people.

 CA> I would like an complete description (or as complete as you can) on how
 CA> it all works with your company (not the tecnical, but the user-side like
 CA> the above questions) and do not forget to mention the name of the phone-

US West.  How it works:  It sucks.

I can't give you the technical details from the modem any more, I sold it.
