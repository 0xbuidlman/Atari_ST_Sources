What is the 'MUST' ('MultiUser extension for SToop')?
  * MUST is a Program that let different persons have different STOOP-
     setups, on the same computer.
  * It allows up to 32 different 'STOOP' setups.
  * Up to 20 Characters can be used in the Login-name.
  * MUST is STOOP-ware, meaning that you may only use this program if you
       are using STOOP.

How to use 'MUST'
  * Create the folder 'USER' in your 'STOOP' folder.
  * Place the 'MUST.PRG in your 'AUTO' folder (make sure that it isn't
      The first program to be run, you will need to use 'STOOP' first.
  * Setup a Default 'STOOP'-setup that every new user, will have in the
      Beginning, make sure that the 'MUST.PRG' is hidden (use the File-
      selector to do that)
  *  Reorder your Auto-folder so that 'MUST.PRG' will start before 'STOOP'
  *  Save your config.
  *  Exit to desktop and move/copy the 'STOOP.CFG' from the 'STOOP'-folder
       to the new 'USER'-folder within STOOP.
  *  Restart your computer and enjoy!!!!!!
