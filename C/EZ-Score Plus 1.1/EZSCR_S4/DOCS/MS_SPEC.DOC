   Preliminary MidiScore Pro spec (7/28/88)

1.  60 staves:

   -- This affects almost every aspect of the program:  formatting, playing,
      printing, auto-scoring, editing, etc.
   -- Window's right margin has a vertical scroll bar and up/down arrows.
      Left-clicking on up/down arrows scrolls by single staff.  Right-clicking
      scrolls by a vertical screenful.
   -- Re-format includes:  display which staves, left edge connectors, label
      and abbreviation for each staff, auto-stemming per staff, etc.
   -- User interface shared for staff-related things (format, play, auto-score,
      clear, etc.)
   -- re-format at line breaks

2.  HybriSwitch capabilities:

   -- Auto-score directly from sequencer.
   -- Shared data area so that other programs will be able to place data onto
      MidiScore's clipboard.
   -- "Sound" menu will be replaced by "Play" menu.  Menu items are "Options",
      "To MIDI", and "To SNG File".  In sound options, midi channel 0 =
      internal sound.  Thus, staves can be independently routed to midi or
      to internal but never to both.  "To SNG File" plays at infinite tempo;
      under HybriSwitch it can go directly to the sequencer's keep buffer.

3.  Printing:

   -- Start printing from a page number.
   -- Print options related to staff labels.
   -- Print batch command.
   -- Manually set line and page breaks.  At a page break optionally change
      page layout.
   -- In Load CNF command, the current config (if any) appears in the item
      selector's selected file field.
   -- show line breaks and page breaks on screen.  Automatically position line
      breaks and page breaks, or manually.
   -- "Justify line(s)" function
   -- Show clef, time sig, key sig at start of each line.  Show clef/time/key
      sig changes at end of each line.  In other words, the printer drive
      doesn't do all this justification/etc.  Instead, it is done within the
      main program and therefore it also happens on the page.
   -- manually define space between each two systems, on each page.

4.  Beaming/Tupleting:

   -- Beam display more intelligent (per Gardner Read).
   -- Diagonal beams and tuplets.  The program automatically selects the
      slant, or this can be selected manually.
   -- Cross staves, cross bar lines, stem-up/down in same beam or tuplet, etc.

5.  Additional symbols:

   -- Single-stem tremolo (articulation).
   -- Multi-measure rest.  For playback also.
   -- Double the number of characters in each font.  The italics font for
      Italian in the upper half of the LYRICS font, etc.
   -- "Unbounded" ties, beams, tuplets forward OR backward.
   -- A series of symbols: ./., .//., .///., etc.  The # of slashes would be
      an attribute.
   -- User-definable line:  Includes wavy (trill extender) lines, etc.
   -- Percussion clef, movable C clefs, alto clef.
   -- Repeat bars within measures.  Repeat bars aren't REALLY bars, but they
      can be placed directly ON a bar.  Printout doesn't number repeat signs.
   -- Multiple simultaneous time signatures.  Alternating time signatures.
   -- Attribute on notes:  Number of time-augmentation dots.  Duration dot on
       note menu.
   -- Open/close brackets.  Used, for example, to tell a pianist to play a
      multi-staff chord with a single hand.
   -- Open and close braces for grouping verses of lyrics.
   -- Other note head styles:  Miniature (grace notes), slashes (must handle
      dots correctly).
   -- Rests within tuplets.  Correctly play them.
   -- Graphics primitives:  Lines, boxes, filled boxes, etc.  Each having
      various attributes (thickness, style, etc.)  For example, dotted line
      can be used for extension lines for 8va/8vb/Ped/etc.
   -- octave notation
   -- user-definable symbols.

6.  Editing:

   -- "All rehearsal marks" under GLOBAL:  display all (like MTST's "Review
      sections"), option here to delete all.
   -- Locate dialog box can locate to next or previous rehearsal mark,
      or locate to start or end of score.
   -- Under SECTION menu:  auto-space.
   -- In lyric-editor, shift-up/down moves an entire verse of lyrics up/down,
      but locks out collisions with already-existing verses.
   -- Tie/Slur thickening:  User-settable thickness at middle, user-definable
      middle.
   -- Delete-notes command can cut beams.
   -- Paste dialog allows any staff to be pasted to any other staff, via a
      60x60 matrix.
   -- "Re-notate" option after insert key or insert clef.  Following key
      signatures are converted.
   -- Check rhythm / re-bar.
   -- Check range.
   -- 2 kinds of transpose:  by chromatic interval or by diatonic interval.
   -- Region command:  "Durate" sets notes and rests to a given duration.
      Key command is <Control>-numeric.
   -- Region command for enharmonic shift:  CTRL *, CTRL -, CTRL + on numeric
      keypad.
   -- Rubber-box a chord, then click on a region command called "move chord".
      The mouse turns into the chord, and you can move it anywhere on the
      screen horizontally, and you can click it anywhere (repeatedly) until you
      type a key (similar to guitar or chord symbol mode).
   -- merge/unmerge staves (create stem-up/stem-down staff out of two other
      single-voice staves), very useful after autoscoring.
   -- Copy/Cut:  Select which staves.  Error message if this cuts slurs, etc.
   -- Other symbols toggle just like notes do.
   -- Key of C = delete key signature at cursor's bar.
   -- Right-click with delete mouse:  "Delayed" delete:  Marks symbol.  Mark
      as many as you want (all on same screen), then confirm/cancel delete.
   -- Note toggle:  Inserting ANY note on an existing note will delete the
      old note, even if their note values don't match.
   -- During chord/guitar/text/etc. modes, control-arrow keys scroll screen
      forward or backward by a measure; shift-control-arrow keys scroll by
      screens.
   -- Blink lyric cursor.
   -- "New" command has 3 buttons:  Cancel, wipe score, wipe score and options.
   -- During add_stretch(), quantize mouse's vertical position to ledger line.
   -- within key signature dialog, click on the sample clef to change it.
   -- clear staves:  not radio buttons.  Clear more than one at a time.
   -- Region command to merge tied notes into larger untied durations.
   -- Multiple regions.  (Select a bunch of regions on one screen, then select
      a region command.)
   -- Build a pallette of rhythms, then there is a midi step entry mode.  In
      this mode, you select a rhythm from the pallette (from ST keyboard or
      from midi keyboard).  Then play on the midi keyboard like Ludwig's pitch
      recorder.  Reduce the current midi step entry system to just toggling
      notes at the current mouse location.  Also a mode where you play like
      Ludwig's pitch recorder, and notes overwrite existing music.

7.  Auto-scoring:

   -- auto-score measures N1-N2.
   -- 4/4 should allow 4 8th notes beamed.
   -- Instead of quantize note-on and note-off:  Quantize note-on and duration.
   -- enharmonic option (instead of alert box)
   -- a minimum velocity (allows auto-score to ignore accidentally played notes
      sometimes).
   -- two levels of rest minimization
   -- When auto-scoring, adopt track names as staff labels, if auto-scoring at
      bar 0.

8.   Hardware key copy protection:
      
      If program has been installed
         If the correct key is connected
            Run
         else
            If the original disk is in drive A or B
               Run
            else
               Crash
      else
         If the original disk is in drive A or B
            If a key is connected
               Give the user the option of installing.  Then run.
            else
               Run
         else
            Crash

9.  Miscellaneous new features:

   -- a mouse-info option which would constantly display the note name
      of the y-unit currently pointed at by mouse.  (Similar to the area in
      the upper right corner of MTST's graphic edit screen.)  Note that this
      is similar to what the play-mode mouse does.  No rulers in either margin.
   -- For wherever applicable, L-click on menu command to execute the command;
      R-click on it to call up dialog box of related options.  A "/r" after
      the menu item indicates it is right-clickable.
   -- Keyboard input in dialog boxes.  This would be useful, for example, in
      selecting key signatures.
   -- Regardless of horizontal scrolling, clef, key, and time signature will
      always be shown on the left end of the staves.
   -- Locate to "null" bar # = locate to start.
   -- Each note has midi attack and release velocities:  These are used for
      playback.  They can be edited.  They are imported from auto-scoring.
   -- Score files are compressed/uncompressed when saving/loading.

10.  Generic text:

   -- different kind of cursor
   -- options: boxed, underlined, etc.
   -- A single text symbol can be longer than 10 characters.
   -- variable number of fonts beyond the mandatory ones.
      At boot time, program looks for TEXT*.FNT in \SCREEN and \PRINTER.
   -- There is a text pallette analogous to chord and guitar pallettes.  Add-
      chord, add-guitar, and add-text subsystems are handled exactly the same.

11. Playback:

   -- Playback interprets dynamics, articulation, etc.
   -- A legato % 1-99.
   -- Patch change for each staff optionally sent at start of playback.
   -- Each voice has a base loudness (0=off) instead of just on/off.
   -- Correctly interpret octave notation.
   -- Optionally output midi start/clock/stop. (Timing good enough to do this?)
   -- Be able to scroll backwards during playback, for repeats.
   -- Looped play option.
   -- Midiplexer.
