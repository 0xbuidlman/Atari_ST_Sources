                            The Midi-Score Series

The Midi-Score ST software series will be comprised of at least two programs,
ranging from the bargain-priced simplified "EZ-Score" (the name is tentative)
to the full-blown top-of-the-line "Midi-Score".  Release dates cannot be
announced yet, nor can specific program features, but here for the first time
in writing I shall attempt to provide a general overview of the Midi-Score
series.  Hopefully by the time you have finished reading this you will be
saying to yourself "I can't live without one of these two programs!"

Basically, any scoring program tries to accomplish one task:  to translate 
musical ideas within your mind into standard music notation on paper.  (This
is VERY basic!)  Scoring programs differ in how they accomplish this.
Some of them include built-in sequencers which record MIDI performances and 
then later -- but not in real-time -- send the equivalent music notation to a 
printer.  Others do not accept MIDI data, but provide powerful word-
processor-like functions for entering music symbols one at a time.  Scoring
programs also differ in the quality of their printed output.  Some programs
strive for publishing quality pages, while others output legible but not
perfect pages which are suitable for handing to musicians at a studio date.

The Midi-Score series is unique among scoring programs in that it provides
multiple forms of data entry, as well as multiple levels of print quality.
Depending on which of the series you are using, some or all of the following
methods of creating notation will exist:

   1) Use the mouse to place music symbols onto the screen.  For example,
      you move the mouse to the symbol menu, click on the stem-up quarter
      note, and then click on the screen where you wish the quarter note to
      be inserted.

   2) Use key commands to place music symbols onto the screen.  For 
      example, use the arrow keys to position the cursor to where you
      want to enter a quarter note.  Then you type a series of keys meaning
      "quarter note, stem up, middle C".

   3) Use combinations of key commands and the mouse.  For example, while
      holding down the keys which mean "quarter note, stem up", point
      with the mouse and click on the middle C position to enter a stem-up
      quarter note there.

   4) Map the controls of any MIDI keyboard to perform cursor
      positioning and editing functions.  Then you use that keyboard to
      step-enter music notation.

   5) Use the "auto-scoring" function to convert a Smpte-Track or
      EZ-Track song file into notation.

These are actually only some of the data entry methods.  There are other
more esoteric methods such as merging lyrics from other files, assigning
pitches to rhythm templates, and so on.

Once we have entered music notation by one of the above methods, or by a
combination of them, the next thing we will want to do is edit.  Let's
face it, few of us approach scoring as Mozart did, so we'll need to
at least change a note here and there, and at most copy and exchange sections,
transpose, re-quantize, re-tie, re-bar, re-key, and re- just about
anything that can be done in the first place.  In my opinion, this is where 
the true power of a scoring program demonstrates itself.  To conserve 
space, I'll just summarize by saying that Midi-Score will have the
widest selection of editing commands that any scoring program has ever had.

Once we are satisfied with our editing, it comes time to print.  Here again
Midi-Score offers multiple options.  There are two epson-compatible dot matrix
print modes -- one for fast draft-quality printouts, and another for the
highest possible quality printout from a dot matrix printer.  If you want
even higher quality printout then hook up a PostScript, HP LaserJet-
compatible, or Atari laser printer and select one of the laser printer drivers.
The resulting output should satisfy even the most demanding of professional
music publishers.

Speaking of meeting demands, you can be sure that the Midi-Score series
will.  We have assembled a board of consultants from among the top professional
musicians in Los Angeles.  These people work in music publishing, 
composition, film-scoring, recording studios, performance, and 
music education.  They have won Grammy awards, Academy awards, numerous gold 
records, and -- most importantly -- all of them have incredibly high standards
for scoring software.  They are overseeing the Midi-Score project and insuring
that the software is excellent in its every detail.



                             The Android STrikes Back

A funny thing happened on the way to the disk duplicator...
As many of you may now be aware, the widely-acclaimed and widely-imitated
DX-Droid ran into some trouble with the -- shall we say -- dark side of the
force.  In response to the incident (about which I cannot say more) Hybrid
Arts agreed to change the program's name to "DX-Android".  We renamed it,
sent the master disk to the duplicator, and when the duplicated disks were
delivered to us we booted one up for test purposes.  I know you won't
believe this, but somewhere enroute from Hybrid Arts to the duplicator or
vice versa, an amazing example of artificial intelligence occurred:  The
program had added 18 new features to itself!  Of course, we tried these out 
and found that all of them offered exciting new capabilities for DX/TX 
owners, so it was obvious what we had to do:  Offer them to registered DX-Droid
owners as an upgrade.  And since there was no work on our part to add these
features, we couldn't honestly demand payment for them, right?  So, the
upgrade costs only $15, which covers the shipping and handling involved in
exchanging a DX-Droid disk for a DX-Android disk.  For those of you who don't
yet have DX-Droid or DX-Android, maybe now is the right time to pick up a copy,
because the program has lowered its suggested retail price to $199.95.  We're
not worried yet -- we'll start worrying when it begins demanding a private
office and its own secretary.  Anyway, welcome to the exciting world of 
DX-Android...

1)  MIDI Thru:  On the Utility Menu there is a MIDI Thru on/off
    function.  It defaults to off.  When on, MIDI data (other
    than system exclusive data) received into the ST's MIDI in port
    will be echoed out of the ST's MIDI out port.

2)  On the catalog screens type <R> to read a file, <E> to erase a file,
    <M> to list more files, <Return> to return to the catalog menu screen,
    <Help> to dump the screen to a printer.

3)  The File to Synth function on the File Menu bypasses the workspace.
    Function AND non-function parameters are transmitted to the synthesizer.

4)  While workspace monitoring is on, the Name Workspace function on the 
    File Menu will send the new name to the synth.

5)  On the Quick Load screen non-existent banks are displayed with 
    parentheses enclosing their bank numbers.   

6)  Hardcopy functions are NOT preceeded by a formfeed.

7)  For the WB F-pars to Synth and Bank to Synth functions on the Bank
    Menu the program prompts for an attenuation level (1-7) to be
    sent to the TX.  This also happens for the quick-load function on 
    the Android menu.

8)  A new copy protection scheme means that there are only two
    ways that you can legally run DX-Android:  (1)  If there is a sync
    box connected to your ST, or (2)  If the original DX-Android program
    disk is in drive A or B.  Note that this allows DX-Android to be run 
    from a hard disk.

9)  The names of Android, Distorted, Glided, etc. voices have been changed 
    to "Android-1", "Android-2", "Average **", "Glide ****", and "Distort **".

10) The "Find Matches" function on the F7 menu:  Specify a workbank slot,
    then specify a maximum number of parameters.  The program will
    then highlight workbank slots that are similar enough to the selected
    slot.  This is highly useful for finding which voices have been created
    by editing other voices, or for finding voices which are identical
    except for their names.

11) The compare functions on the Android menu have been GREATLY expanded.
    Both voices' parameters are displayed in a two-column format.  A third
    column tells the difference between corresponding parameters.

12) On the List Bank screen you can page forward/backward through banks
    by typing <N> and <P>, respectively. 

13) A bug which caused the glide function to sometimes miss its
    end point has been fixed.

14) Typing <A> during a quick-load will abort it.

15) The "Set Distort/Android" function on the Android menu allows you to
    specify which parameters will be affected by subsequent Android-2 and
    Distort functions.  (The "Set Distort/Android" function has NO EFFECT on
    the Android-1 functions.)

16) If DX-Android is booted from a hard disk, then it will expect to find the
    data disk in drive A.  If DX-Android is booted from drive A or B, then it
    will expect to find the data disk in the same drive it was booted from.

17) There is a new manual -- a big, thick, nicely printed one.  Also, the
    new packaging is much more attractive.

18)

The DX-Android / GenPatch two-way conversion program UTILITY.TOS allows you
to convert your DX-Android data into GenPatch files which can then be used
in SmpteTrack's "Auto GenPatch" function.  You can also convert GenPatch
files into DX-Android banks.

The Backup command copies an entire disk.  This is not only highly useful for 
making backups of DX-Android data disks; it also functions as a 
general-purpose disk backup utility.

The Recover command tries to repair damaged information tables on a DX-Android
data disk.  Depending on how badly a data disk is damaged, this command
may or may not succeed.  At best, all banks will be recovered.

DX-Android's cousin, CZ-Android, now also includes a utility program for
converting between CZ-Android and GenPatch files.  Both directions are
supported.
