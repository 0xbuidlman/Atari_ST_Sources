 
The following are 10 conceptual ways in which EZ-Score Plus is superior
to other scoring programs.  These are "conceptual", so many of these are 
difficult to communicate in an advertisement.

1.  EZ-Score is not just a program, it is the start of a series of programs.
    This means that you pay for what you need now, and you can upgrade in the
    future.  You don't have to pay for features that you don't need and might
    not ever need.

2.  The user-interface is incredibly well-designed.  Despite the inherently
    complex nature of scoring, EZ-Score maintains an intuitive user-interface.
    No hard to remember key commands, no complex system of "modes" or
    sequences of actions required to perform a single operation.

3.  Graphics speed!  EZ-Score Plus' graphics make your ST look like it has
    a blitter chip, even if it doesn't.  (It fooled Atari.)  Points #2 and #3
    together make working with EZ-Score like driving a Ferrari.  After working
    with EZ-Score for too long, other programs will feel like Yugos.

4.  Screen and printer graphics are independent.  This means that (a) Graphics
    have been optimized for two different situations -- the screen looks good,
    but the printer looks GREAT.  (b) Print quality is completely unrelated
    to screen resolution.  Regardless of whether you have a color or monochrome
    monitor, print out will be exactly the same.

5.  There are multiple data entry methods (mouse, computer keyboard, MIDI
    keyboard) all available at the same time.  The program multiplexes between
    all data entry devices.

6.  Display and editing speed are not dependent on score size.  This will be
    particularly important in future versions of Midi-Score.  Regardless of
    whether you're working on an eight-bar lead sheet or a massive 60-staff
    orchestral composition with 32000 measures, the program will be just as
    fast.

7.  Even if EZ-Score had to redraw its entire screen it would be remarkably
    fast, but in 99% of the cases EZ-Score is intelligent enough to redraw
    the smallest possible part of the screen that needs to be redrawn.

8.  HybriSwitch compatible.

9.  Compatible with ALL Hybrid Arts ST sequencers.

10. Many other scoring programs struggle with the question "to paint or not
    to paint?"  Some scoring programs are nothing more than elaborate paint
    programs, allowing you to place symbols anywhere on the page with a
    minimum of rules.  Other scoring programs rigidly enforce rules about
    how they think your music should look (and you're not allowed to argue).
    EZ-Score provides the ultimate answer to the paint-or-not-to-paint
    dilemma:  Enforce rules, but allow them to be broken.  For one small
    example, if you put a sharp sign before a note the program will say
    to itself "yes, that's a sensible place to put a sharp sign, so until
    I'm told to do otherwise I'll treat that sharp sign sensibly," but if
    you put a sharp sign inside your lyrics the program will say to itself
    "wow, this is getting really avant-garde, so until I'm told to do
    otherwise I'm not going to apply any rules at all to this particular
    sharp sign."  That's just a very small glimpse of what goes on inside
    EZ-Score Plus!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are some of my favorite specific points about EZ-Score Plus.
Some of these are major programming achievements within the Atari ST world!

1.  MIDI input mapping:  "Map" MIDI controllers, switches, and key numbers
    to symbols and editing functions within EZ-Score.

2.  HybriSwitch.

3.  The symbol menu bar.

4.  Instantly convert between lead sheet / piano / piano-vocal arrangements
    without losing any data.  For example, you can convert from piano-vocal
    to leadsheet and back again.

5.  Delete-mode mouse (bow and arrow) lets you delete ANY single symbol on
    the screen.

6.  Copy/cut/paste functions allow you to assemble a new score out of
    pieces of several other scores.

7.  Expand/compress function is VERY powerful:  Multiply/divide/add/subtract
    horizontal spacing within a section.
   
8.  Endings:  select 1-8 or any combination, open or closed.  EZ-Score can
    easily handle situations like "Ending A is played on first, second, and
    fourth times, ending B is played on the third time, and ending C is
    played on the fifth time."
    
9.  Custom form_do() function:  Dialog boxes are incredibly fast, and left
    and right mouse buttons maintain their negative/positive significance
    even during dialog boxes.  (In normal Atari dialog boxes, only the mouse's
    left button has any effect.)

10. Custom rubber-box:  rubber box in any direction, not just upper-left to
    lower-right.  The box is very smooth and very quick.

11. The key signature dialog box shows relative major/minor keys, and key
    signatures are displayed in both treble and bass clefs.  This actually
    could be regarded as an educational tool.

12. Define up to 128 sections within a score (and sections can overlap!).
    Then you can cut/copy/paste/play/print/expand/compress/etc. sections.  
    For example, it's really easy to convert a song from A/B/A/B form to 
    B/B/A/A.

13. Group command context switching:  Once you have rubber-boxed a region,
    the program decides which group-editing commands should be allowable
    for that region.  For example, you cannot tie notes unless they are
    the same pitch.

14. Auto-stemming:  This can be continuous or after-the-fact.  Continuous
    auto-stemming means the program constantly computes the correct stem
    direction for all notes.  After-the-fact means the program will allow
    you to choose stem directions manually, and then at any time later you
    can select a region and the program will compute correct stem directions
    for all notes in the region.

15. You can create and edit polyphonic music, with multiple voices per staff.
    Left mouse button affects stem-down voices, and right mouse-button
    affects stem-up voices.

16. Output a section of music to a Degas file.  This allows desktop publishers
    to merge musical examples into text files.

17. Independent command and symbol menu bar safeties.  Choose Atari or psuedo-
    Mac style menus.

18. Mouse cross-hair and margin rulers let you accurately line up symbols
    on ledger lines.

19. All options -- even things like mouse button repeat rate -- are saved with 
    each score file.  Options are re-loaded with each score file, and are
    also loaded from an autoload file after boot-up, so every time you run 
    EZ-Score it will come up with your personalized environment.

20. You can create up to 20 chord symbols and 20 guitar chords which
    get saved along with the score file.  As you work, you can select from
    this predefined pallette of 40 chords, or you can create and use chords
    that are not found in the pallette.

21. Files are upwardly compatible.  Each new version of Midi-Score can load
    files from all previous versions.

22. Screen redraw is always minimized.

23. Custom graphics library:  Typically twenty times faster than GEM.
    
24. Playback function:  Program actually SIGHT READS.  This includes mouse
    "play mode".

25. Auto-scoring can be perfectly accurate, or you can select an amount of
    inaccuracy to match the accuracy of your playing style.  Other scoring
    programs are TOO ACCURATE!  Auto-scored output very often is cluttered
    up with rests and ties just because that's the way you played it (but
    didn't mean to).  Beaming can be automatic or manual.  When automatic,
    it obeys the rules of music notation.  Other scoring programs (for
    example, Quiet Lion's) beam, but they don't follow the rules.
