Trnslated from Czech, its original title was "Unrequited Love". 
Very unsuitable for the merriest polka of all time!  In 1939,
American labels for a German recording carried the present title. 
At that time, any mention of liquor on radio was taboo, but the
jukebox business had begun to roll, and in no time at all, the
song could be heard from every box in every tavern in the land.


I include this song in the series because I am an avid connisuer
of the brewed beverage.  I have enjoyed over 150 different kinds
and types of beer.  One of my favorite places to enjoy a "bier"
is at a German shopping village here in southern California.  The
owner, an old German fellow definitely from the old world plays
many favorites such as Marla Elaine (I think that's the title, I
keep getting it mixed up) however, he starts with that song and
ends up in a robust ...Roooollll out the barrreellll!  Well have
a good time tonite!!....and the occupants of the establishment
are suddenly lifted out of their conversations into the heart of
the song hoisting their biers, Jeagermeisters and gluweins!!  If
you don't mind a suggestion, try Spaten Hefe-Weisten bier in a
tall chilled glass with a slice of lemon!!  Then you can get into
the spirit of this song!

Enjoy!
