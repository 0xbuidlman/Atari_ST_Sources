A lot of you jazz and standards musicians will immediately
recognize this tune as one of the premier tunes performed by
topnotch talent.  I've played this tune quite a number of times
myself with all kinds of jazz cats.

The history of this tune is somewhat interesting.  It came from
the "boy meets girl farewell scene" from "Iceland".  Iceland was
a World War II movie.  I loved WWII movies when I was a kid and
kind of still do.  However, probably like most of you, I never
saw this film.  Anyway, the film has long since been filed away. 
Probably never to be seen again. (I read that the actress was a
better ice skater than actress but able to generate warmth at the
movie box offices.)  

If you play this tune, remember, do it with a cool jazz feeling!

Enjoy!
