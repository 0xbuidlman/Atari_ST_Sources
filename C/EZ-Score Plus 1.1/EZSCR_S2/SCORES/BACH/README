This ARC file contains 15 score files, one for each of Bach's two-part
inventions.  These were created by "auto-scoring" (i.e., converting) song
files from SmpteTrack.  No additional editing has been done to them.  Notice
how accurately EZ-Score Plus has transcribed the rhythms.  Some additional
editing would be required to insert clef changes, correct enharmonics,
ornaments, trills, dynamics and phrasing, and so on.  In other words, the
auto-scoring function hasn't done ALL the work for me; just 90% of it.  It
took about two hours to create these score files, which is CONSIDERABLY
less than it would have taken with pen and manuscript paper!
