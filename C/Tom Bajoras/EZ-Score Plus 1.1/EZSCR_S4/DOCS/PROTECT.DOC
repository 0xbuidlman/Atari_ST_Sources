I.  How it works

beats me.

II. How to make a change in the program

Due to the complexity of the A-Lock copy protection, any change in the
program is likely to require the following procedure:

1.  Edit alock.c -- rename do_death() to something else.  Un-comment the
    other do_death().  Compile alock.c and put it into the library.

2.  Clear all conditional compile flags in defines.h, set TUNECHKSUM to 0.
    Recompile according to the instructions in defines.h.  You are now in
    a normal edit/compile/link debug cycle.

3.  Set ALOCKFLAG in defines.h.  Compile according to instructions in
    defines.h.  Improve all improvable modules (run optimize.bat).  Link.

4.  Run ezscore.prg under SID.  It will break in do_death() at which
    point d1.w = the correct value for TUNECHKSUM.

5.  Change TUNECHKSUM in defines.h to its correct value.  Compile and
    improve main.c.  Link.

6.  Run ezscore.prg under SID.  It will break in do_death() at which
    point d0.w= the correct value for MAINCRC.

7.  Change MAINCRC in defines.h to its correct value.  Compile and improve
    thread.c.  Edit alock.c -- comment out do_death, rename the original
    do_death back to "do_death".  Compile alock.c and put it into library.

8.  Link.
