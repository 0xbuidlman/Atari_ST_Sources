                           HOT TIPS FOR EZ-SCORE PLUS

                                 by Tom Bajoras




Now that EZ-Score Plus has become a worldwide hit, we have received feedback
from many users.  In some cases they tell us what they do and don't like; in
other cases they send copies of scores created with the program.  Some of
these are really incredible!  It gives us tremendous satisfaction to create a
tool, place it into talented hands, and then see that tool used in ways beyond
our expectations.  EZ-Score Plus is an incredibly powerful composition tool;
so powerful that its users are finding capabilities that we weren't even aware
of.  In this article we'd like to share some of these capabilities with you.

Maximizing Systems per Page
---------------------------

In the Page Layout dialog box, you can set the number of systems per page to
the maximum allowable number, but (1) this number may be unnecessarily low,
and (2) this number may be unsafe.

(1)  Your score may have too many ledger lines.  Try reformatting repeatedly,
removing ledger lines one at a time from above and below each staff until you
encounter the "Cannot delete that ledger line" error message.  Scroll through
the entire score to see if it isn't TOO compressed, then go to Page Layout and
set the systems per page as high as the program will allow.

(2)  When systems-per-page is maximized, adjacent systems touch, with no
free space between them.  This means that if part of a symbol extends beyond
the highest ledger line above the highest staff or the lowest ledger line
below the lowest staff, that part of the symbol will be cut off on the
printout.  Here is a simple procedure to prevent this:  Once you have
established a format, turn on the mouse cross hair.  Line up the horizontal
line of the cross hair with the highest ledger line above the highest staff.
Scroll through the entire score.  Then repeat this with the cross hair on the
lowest ledger line below the lowest staff.  The cross hair's horizontal line
shows where symbols will be cut off on the printout.  If note stems cause a
problem, try using the Flip command under the Region menu.  Otherwise you may
have to use the Reformat command to add more ledger lines.

Title Page Vertical Layout
--------------------------

You can control the amount of space between the title and the first system
by adding blank lines to the title.    A "blank" line contains nothing
but spaces (space bar); an "empty" line contains nothing at all and is handled
differently.  For example, with 1st title line:  "Somewhere", 2nd title line:
"by Leonard Berstein", the music would begin just below the second title line.
But, with 1st title line: "Somewhere", 2nd title line: "by Leonard Berstein",
3rd title line: "   ", 4th title line: "   ", there will be a significant
amount of space between "by Leonard Bernstein" and the start of the music.
Each line of space can be in large font or small font; this provides even
more control over vertical spacing.  Also, blank lines can be inserted BETWEEN
title lines to control vertical spacing WITHIN the title.

Landscape Printing
------------------

Normally, music is printed in what publishers call "Portrait" orientation.
That is, the page is taller than it is wide.  But, using EZ-Score 1.1, it
is also possible to print in "Landscape" orientation (page width greater
than page height).  Run the CONFIG.TTP program.  Start with the CNF file that
works best for your printer.  Let's use the typical case of 2340 lines per
page and 960 dot columns per line.  These numbers give the dimensions of the
page:  2340 vertical pixels and 960 horizontal pixels.  All we need to do
is change these two numbers.  If we are using 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper, we'll
want to change it to 11 by 8-1/2.  Divide 11 by 8-1/2 to get 1.294.  Divide
2340 by 1.294 to get 1808, and multiply 960 by 1.294 to get 1242.  Rounding
the results gives our new values:  1800 vertical pixels and 1240 horizontal
pixels.  Type in the values, and save the CNF.  EZ-Score 1.1's "Load CNF"
command will allow you to switch between Portrait and Landscape orientations
without exiting the program.

Fake Symbols
------------

Despite EZ-Score's large symbol vocabulary, there are still quite a few things
it cannot do, such as octave notation (8va), grace notes, and multiple
measure rests.  If you need to use these symbols, and you can't wait
for Midi-Score Professional, there still is hope:  You can "fake" the
symbols.  What this means is that there are ways of creating the symbols, but
that these ways may require more time and work than the equivalent "real"
ways that will be implemented in Midi-Score Professional.  Let's take a look
at a few suggestions that have come to us through beta testers and users:

1) Octave notation:  Using the free-text mode, you can type "8va", "15ma", and
other related symbols.  Just enter free-text mode, type 8-v-a, and click the
text onto the screen.  Next, enter general-purpose line mode.  Draw a
horizontal line extending over or under the notes that are to be affected by
the octave shift.  Close off the section by putting a short vertical line at
the end of the horizontal line.  If you want to be fancy, you can simulate a
dashed line by drawing a series of short horizontal lines instead of one long
one.  The only thing "fake" about the symbol is that the playback function
will not recognize it.

2) Multiple measure rests:  This again is a combination of free-text and
general-purpose lines.  First, enter line mode.  Type left/right arrow keys
until the line has maximum width.  Draw a horizontal line centered over the
center line of the staff.  Then type the right arrow to set the line to its
minimum width.  Draw vertical lines at each end of the horizontal line.  Exit
line mode.  Enter free-text mode.  Using whichever font you prefer, center a
number over the multiple measure rest.  Again, the only thing "fake" about the
symbol is that the playback function will not recognize it.

3) "Open-ended tie" for a note tied across a repeat symbol:  The note at the
end of the repeated section is tied forward, and the note at the beginning of
the repeated section is tied backward.  A real tie cannot be used in this
situation.  A tie and a slur don't look any different when the slur is
horizontal and set to its second-to-minimum thickness -- so if you use a slur
instead of a tie no one will ever know, except of course for the program's
playback function.

4) Grace notes:  Unfortunately, these work only in simple cases.  The smallest
font contains miniature notes.  Enter free-text mode, type F1 (smallest font),
and then type control-A through control-H to see the range of available notes.
These miniature notes can be positioned as text where the grace notes should
be.  However, they cannot be beamed or placed on ledger lines.

5) Unusual uses for free-text:  Using the miniature notes mentioned in (4),
you can type notation such as "quarter note = half note" which may be needed
above a bar where the meter's denominator changes.  Use free-text to type
lyrics above rests or in other unusual positions.  Type bar numbers at bars
other than the first of each printed system.  Leave notes to yourself.
("There's something wrong here", "Transpose this section down a fifth",
"I'm finished editing up to here"...)

These are just a few of the tips we've collected from various sources.  If
you'd like to share a tip with other EZ-Score Plus users, write to Hybrid Arts.
We'll include it in the next issue of HybriSync.  Your constructive criticism
and suggestions are, as always, welcome.  We listen!
