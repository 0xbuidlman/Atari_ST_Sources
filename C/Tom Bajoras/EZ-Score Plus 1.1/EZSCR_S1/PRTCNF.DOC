EZ-Score Plus printer configuration file documentation - crd 880110

The printer configuration file is a short binary data file that tells EZ-Score
Plus's printout module about the printer with which it is working.  It is
stored in the PRINTER folder on the EZ-Score Plus fonts disk under the name
PRINTER.CNF.

The first 16 words in the file are integer values that describe the printer
and the size of the paper that is most commonly used in it.

  Byte
 offset     Ref Name       Purpose

   0        pins           number of pins on the print head (9 or 24)
   2        lines_inch     dots per inch, vertically, in final mode
   4        bytes_line     dots per inch, horizontally, divided by 8
   6        full_lf        24 for 9-pin printers, 28 for 24-pinners
   8        intrlv_lf      1 for 9-pin printers, 0 for 24-pinners
   10       i_nxln_lf      22 for 9-pin printers, 0 for 24-pinners
   12       top_margin     top margin, counting down from top of the page
   14       bottom_margin  bottom margin, counting down from top of the page
   16       left_margin    left margin (edge of staff lines) from left edge
   18       right_margin   right margin (edge of staff lines) from left edge


The next 6 words (up through byte offset 31) are reserved, and should always
be zero.

The rest of the file, starting at byte offset 32, is comprised of several
Pascal-style strings (first byte is length of the rest of the string, which
is not null-terminated), as follows:


String#  Ref Name    Purpose

   0     cancan      Clear printer's buffer
   1     set_8_72    Set 8/72" (or 16/144") line spacing
   2     set_1_216   Set 1/216" (1/144") line spacing
   3     set_22_216  Set 22/216" (15/144") equivalent line spacing
   4     reset_1_6   Reset to default (usually 1/6") line spacing
   5     fmode       set for 960 pixels/line, to be followed by two bytes for
                     the data length (byte-reversed)
   6     dmode       set for 960 pixels/line double speed, as above


As a structural example, let's say that the printer's manual tells us that
the "clear printer buffer" command (for string 0) consists of a single byte,
0x18 (CTRL-X, CAN, ^X, 24, however you want to think of it).  String 0,
therefore, would consist of the following bytes:

   0x01 0x18

which the program will interpret as a string length of one byte followed by
the one byte comprising the actual data.  But let's say, for some reason,
some weird manufacturer decides to implement the "clear buffer" command as
three bytes, 0x1B 0x1B 0x1A (or ESC ESC CTRL-Z, if you prefer).  This would
appear in a printer config file as

   0x03 0x1B 0x1B 0x1A

which the program will think of as a string length of three followed by the
three bytes of data.

If these strings do not fill the file out to a total size of 128 bytes, then
the file should be padded with nulls (zeroes) to 128 bytes.
