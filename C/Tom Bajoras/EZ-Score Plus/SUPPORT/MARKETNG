1.  Provide Hybrid Arts sales department with support documents:

	-- comparisons of EZ/MS versus competitors
	-- spec sheets
	-- reverse-spec sheets (telling what EZ/MS canNOT do, and why, and how
		to fake things )
	-- lists of features to be implemented in future

2.  Create dealer demo package.

	-- demo version, example scores, slide show, mouse macro	demo, spec sheets,
		example printouts, "EZP" files for printer "slide"	show, playback loop.
	-- all in one neat little package.

3.  "Hands-on" dealer training seminars.  Go to dealership, or have them
	 come to classes at Hybrid.

4.  Visit dealers in-person:  West LA, Logical Choice, Midi City

***5.  Compose and learn a super-exciting demo for trade shows, seminars, etc.

6.  Keep an eye out for shows to attend, bring these to Frank's attention.
	 Maybe go to them personally even if Hybrid doesn't go:  Songwriters'
    convention, music educators', church musicians', etc.

7.  Maintain visibility in Hybrid newsletter.

8.  Maintain visibility on BBS's, especially Hybrid Arts' BBS.

***9.  Make a very flashy demo program -- not really a demo "version", more
	 like a commercial -- and spread it on BBS's.

10. Personally be responsible for finding magazines to review it -- music AND
	 computer magazines.  List these magazines and a personal contact at each,
	 call those contacts and send review copies.  Give a copy of this list
	 to Frank.

    Some examples:  Keyboard, EM, MT, MCS, Music Ed Journals,
	 Microtimes, BAM, European magazines, ST-Log, Start, ST Applics, Chez
    Bridges, User groups, ST-Express, UpBeat, Musician, etc.

11. Write some computer magazine articles about scoring software.  Idea:
	 a very technical article for Dr. Dobbs.

12. Post brochures on bulletin boards on college campuses.

13. Assemble a package of photocopies of reviews.

14. Write a simple scoring program and submit it to ST-Log or STart

15. Create foreign-language versions for international release.

16. Figure out speech.tos (or incorporate it), and create a talking demo!
    Would be really cool for CZ-Android.

17. Create and sell disk-based books of sheet music.

18. Supply alternate fonts on BBS or disk for minimal charge.  Document how
    to make your own.

19. Put together benchmark scores.  Print them on all competing programs.
	 Put together a package.  For each, state: print time, list of hardware,
	 price of software.  Sonus Superscore, Steinberg Masterscore, EZ-Score+,
	 Quiet Lion, The Copyist, Final Score (if it really exists).  Hybrid Arts
	 should get an official copy of each of these programs.

20. Do selective mailings:

	-- recording studios (use a current directory, found in MIX)
	-- universities
	-- high schools
	-- music "trade" schools
	-- Atari user groups

21. Do non-hype seminars/classes:

	-- songwriter showcase
	-- universities
	-- music stores
	-- Atari user group meetings
