
There are five font files in the FONTS folder on the EZ-Score Plus disk.  These
fonts were designed for the U.S. keyboard.  At present, nine other Atari ST
keyboards are in use throughout the world:  Swedish, Danish, Norwegian,
German, British, Italian, French, Spanish, and Japanese.  If you are using one
of these other keyboards you may be experiencing problems with EZ-Score text,
including lyrics, titles, rehearsal marks, and copyright messages.  Characters
may be wrong or missing.

The solution to these problems is to replace the files in the FONTS folder.
Included with this memo you will find a disk containing the public domain
font editor GEMFED.  You must load each EZ-Score font into GEMFED, make the
required changes, and save the file back to the FONTS folder.  GEMFED's
operation is fairly simple:  Load the font, and then for each bad key type
the key and use the mouse to redraw the character.  When all the bad keys
have been replaced, save the font under the same name from which it was
loaded.  There is a doc file, GEMFED.DOC, which explains in greater detail
how to use GEMFED.

When version 1.1 of EZ-Score becomes available these changes will all have to
be done again.  To avoid this you can send us your modified fonts files, and
we will make the necessary changes to the 1.1 fonts.
