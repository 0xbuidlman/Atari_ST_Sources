As I have read, British lyricist Mr. Kennedy, took a visit in
1935 to then romantic island of Capri.  He was evidently inspired
by the bright red sails on the little Italian boats against the
purple Mediterranean sunset.  

This tune soared straight to the top of the American charts.

Enjoy!
