Torch songs, torch songs, torch songs!  Here is an example of one
of the more famous and typical songs written in that idiom.  It
was written to be performed at a fast tempo in order to set up a
dance number in "Show Boat".  

Helen Morgan performed this in the show as the tragic mulatto
Julie and by Norma Terris as the ingenue Magnolia.  However, it
was Miss Morgan, with her big dewey eyes an tremendous delivery,
who put her personal seal on the song, singing it in nightclubs-
perched on top of the piano-at a "much' slower tempo.  

This song has great chords in my personal opinion, although I did
not take the time to include them for you guitar players. 
However, it contains pretty straight forward jazz chording
progressions.  

Enjoy!
