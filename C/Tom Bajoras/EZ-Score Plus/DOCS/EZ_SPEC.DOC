                          EZ-Score Plus Specifications
             (* indicates a feature added or improved in version 1.1)

    "Auto-Score" from a sequencer song file (EZ-Track, EZ-Track Plus,
    SyncTrack, SmpteTrack, etc.), then edit.  Or, create a score using the 
    mouse, keyboard, or MIDI.  All data entry methods are available simul-
    taneously.

    Choose up to three staves, in four score formats:  solo, piano, 
    piano/vocal, or trio.  Amount of space between staves is variable to
    allow for multiple verses of lyrics or for music with many ledger lines.

    Over 140 symbols:  notes, rests, accidentals, clefs, rehearsal marks, 
    bar lines, dynamics, ornaments, articulations, repeat signs, bowing, etc.

    Time signatures from 1/1 to 99/64.

    All major and minor key signatures.

    Beams, ties, slurs, all kinds of tuplets, crescendo/decrescendo hairpins,
    lines, etc.  Detailed user control over symbols:  For example, you can
    control the placement, height, thickness, slant, and curve direction of
    slurs.

    1st/2nd/3rd/...8th endings

    Lyrics:  multiple verses above or below any staff.  Automatic centering
    beneath notes.

    Chord Symbols:  Completely variable, so you can create complex chords
    (major, minor, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, suspensions, augmented, diminished,
    etc.)

    Guitar chord frames:  Use presets or create your own.

    Flexible title page formatting.

    Instantly locate to any bar number or to a rehearsal mark.

    Copy/cut/paste sections within the same score or even between multiple
    scores.

    Playback over MIDI or from the ST's internal sound.  Play the entire
    score, a screen, a range of measures, or individual chords and rests.

*   Print out on 9- and 24-pin Epson-compatible dot-matrix printers.  Powerful
    printer configuration editor allows defining paper shape and size.  Three
    print modes:  rough (low quality / fast), draft (medium quality / medium
    speed), final (high quality / slow).  Also compatible with wide carriage
    printers.

    Export sections to Degas files for additional editing or for importing
    into desktop publishing programs.

    Options:  several kinds of safety, automatic stem direction (program
    applies music theory), large mouse cross-hair (helps in editing), etc.

    Step data entry from MIDI.  Play notes on a MIDI keyboard, and see
    notes instantly appear on the screen.

    For the ultimate in manual control, you can insert and delete small 
    amounts of space between symbols.

    EZ-Score Plus runs in medium res color or high res monochrome.  The
    latter is recommended, but screen resolution will not affect the quality 
    of printed output.

    EZ-Score Plus files are upwardly compatible to all future versions of 
    Midi-Score.

    HybriSwitch compatible.

*   Variable note head styles:  Round, diamond, 'x' (percussion notation),
    invisible, etc.

*   "Free Text" mode allows ANY text in ANY font to be typed ANYwhere on the
    score.

    Create and save a custom environment, including all options (even things
    like mouse button repeat rate!).  Every time you run the program this
    environment will automatically be set up.

*   Super-high-resolution printer font achieves NPQ ("near publishing quality")
    on any alt-help-compatible dot matrix printer.
