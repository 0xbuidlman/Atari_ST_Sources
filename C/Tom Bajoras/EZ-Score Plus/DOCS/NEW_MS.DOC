MIDISCORE PRO SPEC 12/14/89

MidiScore Professional, for a number of technical reasons, will be divided
into two programs:  An "edit module" and a "print module."

   EDIT module:

   -- Edit / play / auto-score / un-score / print up to 4 staves.
   -- Load / Save SCO files.
   -- Import / Export STF files.  A STF file ("staff" file) can contain
      up to 4 staves.
   -- beaming and tupleting:  Diagonal, stem up/down within same group,
      cross-staff, cross-bar, etc.
   -- more editing features: transpose, auto-space, more flexible curve-
      drawing, check rhythm/rebar, re-notate option for key and clef changes,
      durate, move chords, vertical component for copy/cut, cross-staff
      pasting, etc.
   -- Additional symbols include all clefs, octave notation, grace notes,
      multi-measure rests, tremolo, more text fonts, unbounded ties/beams/
      tuplets, graphics primitives including user-definable line styles,
      double/triple-dotted notes and rests, more note head styles (including
      user-definable), user-definable symbols, etc.
   -- A completely new midi input mode ("rhythm template")
   -- For printing, line and page breaks can be inserted manually.

   Note that the EDIT module can print, but print-out is limited to 4-staff
   formats, and only on dot matrix printers.

   PRINT module:

   -- Import up to 60 (?) staves from STF files.
   -- Build pages on screen in a truly WYSIWYG environment.  Powerful page
      formatting and editing commands.
   -- This is a purely graphic program.  There is no midi input or output.
   -- Load/Save PGE ("page") files.
   -- Interchangeable print fonts for different size outputs.
   -- Supports dot matrix, HP LaserJet, PostScript devices, depending on which
      printer driver has been loaded.
