I.  System Setup

   -- For continuous print demo: monochrome 1040ST system, Citizen MSP-10/-50
      printer, an adequate supply of printer paper, possibly an extra printer
      ribbon.

   -- For main demo system:  monochrome Mega ST4 system, midi keyboard
      (DX7, DX21, etc.), multitimbral playback device (TX802, MT32, etc.),
      audio monitor system, hard disk.

   -- All required files are on each double-sided floppy disk.  Files should
      be copied to the hard disk on the main demo system.  The three floppy
      copies optionally can be given away, but only to VERY important people.

   -- Channel assignment on multitimbral device:  1= flute, 2= piano, 3= bass.
      The controller keyboard can be subsituted for one of these channels,
      of course.  It is IMPORTANT that these channel assignments be obeyed,
      because EVERY example score uses them.
      
   -- Additional materials needed:  Brochures, demo disks (same as the NAMM
      demo disks), photocopies of the SOMEWHER.SCO printout, an actual
      EZ-Score 1.0 package (to show the quality of the manual).

II. Secondary Demoes

   -- The "continuous print" demo should be printing the SOMEWHER.SCO
      repeatedly.  Looping is not automatic, so you will need to restart
      the printout after each printout has finished.  For the first printout,
      power up the printer with the print head positioned just below a
      page perforation.  On subsequent printouts there should be no need to
      touch the printer at all, even if a printout is aborted.  This is
      because the program always positions the print head so that it is
      ready to start another page.  Do NOT attempt to print on any printer
      other than an MSP-10 or MSP-50.  At the moment, there is only one 
      printer configuration in the PRINTER folder, and that configuration
      is for the MSP-10/-50.
      
   -- If you must leave the main demo system unattended for a few minutes,
      the best thing to do is load in the IDENTITY.SCO, make sure the cursor
      is at bar 0, and play.  If channel assignments are correct, playback
      should be through piano.  This is a very impressive demo, because there
      is quite a bit of midi data being generated but the screen chase does
      not fall behind!  The demo lasts about two minutes.
      
   -- If you must leave the main demo system unattended for an extended
      period of time, load in the MOTET.SCO.

III.  Ideas Which I Want Communicated

   -- EZ-Score 1.0 is currently available at a suggested retail price of 99.99
      (U.S.).  EZ-Score 1.1 will be available April 1, at 149.99 (U.S.).
      Users who purchase EZ-Score 1.0 before April 1 may upgrade to 1.1 for
      $15 (U.S.).

   -- The primary difference between 1.0 and 1.1 is print quality.  (Compare
      the SOMEWHER.SCO printout with the cover of the manual.)  There are
      other new features in 1.1:

      -- Fully supports 24-pin dot matrix printers.
      -- Optional hardware key protection.
      -- You can place ANY text in ANY font ANYwhere on the score.
      -- You can MOVE individual notes.
      -- Improved REGION commands.
      -- Metronome marks, rehearsal marks, and endings have variable vertical
         positions.
      -- Two kinds of inserting and deleting.
      -- Keyboard controlled horizontal spacing.

      There are many small new features, not worth listing completely here.

   -- We do not have a reliable estimate of when MidiScore ST Professional will
      be available.  All we know about its feature is:
      
      -- 60 staves
      -- optional laser printer support
      -- diagonal beaming, cross-staff beaming
      -- grace notes, percussion notation, more text fonts
      -- score-to-sequence conversion utility
      -- midiplexer support
      -- more editing:  transpose, quantize, auto-space, re-notate, re-bar,
         check rhythm, check range
      -- page editor

      It is important to note that EZ-Score *** IS *** Midi-Score.  So if
      anyone asks "when will you start working on Midi-Score?" the correct
      answer is "over a year ago."
      
   -- EZ-Score 1.0 and 1.1 work in monochrome or color.  Monochrome is
      preferred for its higher screen resolution, but printout is identical
      in either case.
      
   -- EZ-Score 1.0 will work with ANY Epson-compatible 9-pin dot matrix
      printer.  EZ-Score 1.1 will work with ANY Epson-compatible 9- or 24-pin
      dot matrix printer.  The official compatibility test for a printer is
      check to see if it can correctly do an Alt-Help screen dump.
      
   -- EZ-Score 1.1 can be translated into any European language in only a few
      hours.  We will supply a list of English phrases.  Once the foreign
      equivalents have been returned to us, we can create a version of EZ-Score
      in that language within a SINGLE DAY.
      
   -- The fonts supplied on the EZ-Score 1.0 and 1.1 disks are American.  We
      can supply a font editor kit (at no cost) to convert the fonts into
      any foreign language.

IV. Main Demo

   A.  "A picture is worth a thousand words."
   
   -- Load in SOMEWHER.SCO.
   -- Demonstrate reformatting:  Reformat to piano, then to leadsheet, then
      back to piano/vocal.  Demonstrate variable spacing between staves.
   -- Scroll forward by right-clicking on the right scroll arrow, then scroll 
      back by right-clicking on the left scroll arrow.  Explain "how EZ-Score
      thinks of music."
   -- Point out the various symbols on the screen:  Lyrics (any number of
      verses above and/or below any stave(s), chord symbols, guitar symbols,
      slurs.  If you have time, edit the lyrics, insert a chord, insert a
      guitar chord, delete the chord and guitar chord, insert/delete space.
   -- Play it.  Notice that the 3-against-4 rhythm plays correctly.  Point
      out that anything-against-anything plays correctly.  Unlike the
      sequencer, EZ-Score can DYNAMICALLY VARY its ppq as required to achieve
      the best possible fit of proportional groupings.
   -- Go to the mouse's PLAY MODE.  Hold down the right button and slide
      the mouse over the first two measures of staff 1, then slide it over
      the first two measures of staff 2.  In other words, this is an
      ORCHESTRATOR'S TOOL.

   B.  Auto-Scoring
   
   -- Load in AUTOSCOR.SCO.  This contains preset options.  Auto-Score
      the BACH.SNG.  Explain the options within the dialog box, but don't
      tamper with any of them, except that staff 3 must be set for track 2.
      If you forget to do this you'll know because the program will give you
      the transpose/ignore/cancel alert box.  If this happens, click on
      cancel and auto-score it again.
   -- Demonstrate that the program can play back over midi or internal or
      both at the same time.  During playback type TAB to pause (then any
      key to un-pause), function keys to change tempo, UNDO to reestablish
      the original tempo, carriage return to abort.
   -- Go to SOUND OPTIONS and explain the various options there.  Turn on
      screen chase.  Explain why you might want to turn it off.  Play the
      score.  Note that with screen chase on, there might be a delay between
      typing a key and hearing the result (for example, the playback won't
      abort immediately after typing RETURN).
      
   C. "For the paper people"
   
   -- Do a NEW.  Then INSERT BLANK MEASURES.
   -- Run the mouse through the symbol menu.  We're so used to this that we
      don't even think about it, but make sure you give people time to be
      impressed with the wide selection of symbols on each menu.
   -- Click some notes onto the screen.  Turn off auto-stemming.  Explain the
      usage of LEFT and RIGHT mouse buttons throughout the program.  Turn
      auto-stemming back on.
   -- Click symbols onto the screen:  rests, ornaments (above/below notes),
      dynamics, articulation (for example, pedalling), measures (point out
      that playback DOES obey repeats and ending numbers).
   -- Depending on how much time you have, demonstrate the flexibility of
      the tools on the SPECIAL menu.  If you don't have enough time, just
      tell them:
      
      -- Hairpins have completely variable length, height, slant, descresc/
         cresc.
      -- Slurs have completely variable length, height, slant, thickness,
         over/under.
      -- Text:  Type ANY text in ANY font ANYwhere on score.
      -- Chords and guitar chords:  Up to 20 can be stored with each score,
         but there is no limit to how many different chords you can have in
         a score.

   -- Make sure MIDI Input is enabled, then do some midi step entry.  Show the
      midi step entry map.
      
   -- If you have time, enter a few notes from the computer keyboard.
   
   -- Explain that ALL input modes are ALWAYS available, SIMULTANEOUSLY.
   
   D.  Editing -- Note:  Demonstrate as many of these as you have time for.
       If you don't have enough time, then just list them.
   
   -- REGION commands: beam/unbeam, tie/untie, tuplet/untuplet
   -- SECTION commands:  copy/cut/paste, endings.  Note that the clipboard
      can be used to transfer data between different scores, so in effect
      you can cut several scores into pieces and then reassemble them into
      a new score!  Combined with the rehearsal mark "register concept" it
      is really easy to preview different arrangements:  verse/verse/chorus,
      or verse/chorus/verse, and so on.
   -- INSERT commands:  rehearsal mark, locate.

   E. Printing
   
   -- 3 modes:  trade off between quality and speed.
   -- title page editor
   -- Export to Degas (This isn't worth mentioning unless you have an
      overabundance of time.)
      
   F. Miscellaneous
   
   -- All of working environment can be customized and saved in an AUTOLOAD
      score.
   -- switcher
