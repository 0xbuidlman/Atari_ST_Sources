Differences between PureC's PCTOSLIB.LIB and TOS.LIB
====================================================
Latest changes: 12/02/2006 by Philipp Donze

General:
--------
- Type: "int" is replaced by "short"
- Structures updated to be compatible with latest "mintlib"
  (e.g. KEYTAB, but not DTA)

Bios:
-----
- SetExc() takes vector parameter as type "long" and returns vector as
  "long". This is easier for handling and conforming to mintlib.

XBios:
------
- Renamed Initmouse() to Initmous()
- Floprd(),Flopwr(),Flopfmt(),Flopver() use type "long" for parameter
  "filler" (instead "void *")! Be careful when compiling old 
  applications which used the old binding!
- Dosound() doesn't return a value.
- Renamed KBDVECS to KBDVBASE.
- Renamed Esetshift()/Egetshift() to EsetShift()/EgetShift()
- New system call Waketime() for ST-Book added
- Falcon030 calls: adapted more consistent naming convention (from
  mintlib):
     -every XBios call starts with an uppercase letter
     -added VsetScreen(): equals Setscreen() with extra parameter
     -added Validmode()
     -VsetMask() takes only two (2) parameters instead three (3)
     -Vsetmode()      renamed to     VsetMode()
     -mon_type()      renamed to     VgetMonitor()
     -Buffptr() takes as argument a pointer to "SndBufPtr" instead of a
      pointer to "long".

Gemdos:
-------
- In accordance with most of public available documentations (and in
  contrary to mintlib implementation), I implemented DOSTIME structure
  as containing "unsigned short" elements.
- Renamed LINE to CCONLINE (as in mintlib implementation)
- Types of return values changed for:
     Cauxin(), Cprnout(), Cconws(), Tsetdate(), Tsettime(), Dfree(),
     Dcreate(), Ddelete(), Dsetpath(), Fclose(), Fdelete(), Fattrib(),
     Fforce(), Dgetpath(), Mfree(), Mshrink(), Fsfirst(), Fsnext(),
     Fdatime()
- Mshrink() and Frename() do not take a "0" (=zero argument) as the first
  parameter as it was in original Pure C binding.
- Contrary to MagiC definition of shared libraries (SHARED_LIB), we 
  use SLB_HANDLE because it's a more appropriate name and it's also used
  under this name in mintlib.
- The structure BASPAG (sometimes also called PD) is replaced by 
  BASEPAGE like in mintlib.
- Structure SYSHDR has been replaced by OSHEADER.
- Structure COMMAND has been removed.
- In contrary to mintlib implementation, all "new" system calls return
  "long". It's up to the user of the function to cast the result to the
  correct type. But be aware: these "new" system calls don't exist on
  older systems, so check for error codes (EINVFN or ENOSYS defined in
  "errno.h") before using the result!
- Some structures from mintlib are not yet implemented and the 
  corresponding functions take "void *" as parameter type.
  Missing structures are:
    stat, timeval, timezone, pollfd, iovec, sockaddr, msghdr, shmid_ds, 
    __semun, sembuf, msqid_ds
