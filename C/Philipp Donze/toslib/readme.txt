TOS.LIB for Pure C (1998-2006 by Philipp Donze)
==================
A library implementing all(?) system calls of modern TOS compatible systems.
This library for Pure C was developed to replace the old and incomplete 
"PCTOSLIB.LIB" of the original Pure C distribution.

Installation
------------
Copy the content of the "include" folder to your Pure C installation's "include"
folder replacing existing files (sure, you can do a backup before!). Copy the
"tos.lib" into your "lib" folder. To use in your projects the new library replace
references to PCTOSLIB.LIB by TOS.LIB.


Copyright
---------
The implementation of TOS.LIB is based on publicly available sources like
TOS.HYP, mintlib and books like Atari Compendium, Atari Profibuch. It may be
distributed freely in the hope it's serving other developers for the TOS 
platform.
