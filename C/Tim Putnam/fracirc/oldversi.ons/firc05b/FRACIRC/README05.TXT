	Fracirc Beta V0.5.
	==================
	
	Hi everyone. Sorry this has been such a long time coming, but 
I've been working my socks off lately to try and make up.

	What you have here is more or less a complete reprogram of the 
last beta (0.4). I hope you will notice a vast improvement of speed 
and in accuracy of the window updates.

Whats in this version
=====================

10 DCC channels send / receive
Assignable colours
6 windows, with up to 10 chat channels. 1 Window for DCC operations.
Things work! <g> (I hope)

Whats missing?
==============

Colours only act upon outgoing text atm, and get blacked out in a 
redraw.
There are virtually no controls over the DCC at the moment. Once a 
file is going, its going. The only command is "/reset". Enter this in 
the DCC window to completely reset all transfers.
Window updating, although improved is in need of a bit of tweaking.
DCC files are always received to C:\. Full path configuration coming 
up next.
Various options about operation.



	Any bugs/reports will be very very welcome.
	
	Cheers for now,
	
	Tim
