 Fracirc V0.51b updated.
 
 Hiya people. From what I could see the last version of Fracirc to be 
sent round had a /lot/ of problems. I've fixed quite a lot of things 
between then and now, so could you all have another go with this one 
and see if there are any improvements? (RSCs will please Peter more 
<g>).
