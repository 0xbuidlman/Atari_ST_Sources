	Due to severe illness over the past 5 months, you are not exactly
getting what I had invisioned about a year ago.  When I discovered that
in all likelyhood that I would not recover in time for when the ad
was supposed to show up in EM for this editor, it was too late.  I am
now in the final stages of recovery and hope to polish this program
up quite a bit.  After all, I wrote this program for myself, and am
offering it to the public as a means of spreading around some of my
good fortune and hard work.

	The manual that I was writing is not done yet.  The text of it
is in the file DXED.DOC.  This file was made using FIRSTWORD.  It is
not directly printable without that program.  It used to be that
Firstword was included with the ST, but no more.  So, if you don't
have this word processor, I will try to work something out.  The
program is, I hope, easy to use.

	The source code is included in DXED.ARC.  It was written for
the MEGAMAX 1.1 compiler.  The program that you have on the disk
however, is compiled with MEGAMAX 2.0.  Not quite the same.  I tested
the program, it seems to work now.

	I hope to have an update soon.  If you wish to have a password
on my BBS, send me a card with you name, phone number, and a sequence of
4 to 8 letters to use as your password.  If you want to just download
material, the phone number is (805)-967-5264.  My voice line is
(805)-967-8415.  Thank you.
