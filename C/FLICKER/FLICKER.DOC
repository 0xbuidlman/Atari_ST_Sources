                    =====================

Instructions by Greatguy.


There  was  no instruction document with my copy of flicker.  For anyone who is
in  the  same  boat  I  have  written  some.   I  cannot  guarantee  that these
instructions explore the full potential of this art/animation package, but they
should at least make it easier to get into.

There  is no mention within the program as to the author or his/her whereabouts
-the  "INFO"  selector simply says that it is version 2.0 and copyright Dancing
Flame.   This  is  a pity because the author deserves some credit for this neat
little package.  Anyhow....



1....INTRODUCTION

    Flicker is a very fast program.  Not as powerful as programs like Neochrome
but easier to use and with the added feature of simple page-flipping animation.
The  user has 26 screens (on 1 Meg) at his disposal and can use these as either
multiple canvasses or as individual frames of an animated sequence.  This means
less  loading/saving of work since you can copy each stage of your drawing to a
new  screen  and  then  simply  go  back to the last screen if you make a major
cock-up.

    There  is  no mucking about with fancy icons or menu screens and thus it is
ideal  for  doing  draft versions of your artwork, and then perhaps loading the
picture  into  something  like Neochrome for touch-up.  Operation is simple and
all  the basic features that you would expect to have in a graphics package are
there including stuff like Polygon, Spray, Zoom etc.

    Flicker  also  has  page-flip  animation features.  This is where sucessive
screens  are  displayed one after the other thus giving the effect of movement.
This technique is very memory hungry and so only 26 frames can be stored on a 1
Meg  machine.   There  are  more  advanced animation methods which use far less
memory  but you can still do a great deal with this feature, despite its memory
demands.

    The  one  thing  that  the program SEEMS to lack is the ability to define a
palette by setting the RGB values although the facility to load colour palettes
from disk is there.



2....USING FLICKER

    Drawing  is  done using the mouse.  In most cases the selected function can
be used by holding down the left mouse button.

    Right  button  toggles between the drawing screen and a series of drop down
menus at the top of the screen.  Select the function you wish to use by placing
the  mouse pointer over name of that function until it is displayed in reverse,
then click the left button.

    The  drawing  cursor  is  a  cross  by  default, but this can be changed by
selecting a different brush type.

    Many  of  the  functions  can  be selected using the keyboard whilst on the
drawing  screen.   Keyboard  commands  for  each  function will be displayed in
brackets [ ]  in these instructions.

    Here are the individual menus with an explaination of each of the tools...



                FILE
                ====

L.PIC         -Loads a picture of the type selected (Degas or Neo) from disk.

S.PIC         -Saves a picture of the selected type to disk.

L.CEL         -Loads a clipboard picture (no palette).

S.CEL         -Saves the clipboard (without palette).

L.SEQ         -Loads an entire animation sequence.

S.SEQ         -Saves an entire animation sequence.

L.COL         -Loads colour palette.

S.COL         -saves colour palette.

EXIT [Q]      -Quit to desktop.



                EDIT
                ====

UNDO [Undo]   -Undoes the last action on the drawing screen.  Use to correct
               any mistakes that you JUST made.  Undo only works if you use it
               right after you've made the mistake.  If you do any more
               drawing after that, then Undo will simply remove the last thing
               that you did.

Blue Pic [(]  -Sets all colours on the screen to colour 3.  If you have
               started drawing and you need to fill different shapes with the
               same colour, then you can outline them in a different colour,
               fill them, and then get rid of the outline colours with this
               option.  This is useful because fill tends to wait until it
               meets a colour boundry before it stops.

Unblue Pic [)]-Sets all pixels drawn in colour 3 to colour 0.  Effectively,
               this erases everything done in colour 3.  You can therefore lay
               down a grid, or guidelines for your drawing in colour 3, and
               then remove them with this option.

Clear Pic [Backspace]
               -Erases the current drawing screen.

Clear Seq      -Erases all screens in memory.  Returns sequence counter to 1.

Cut [f1]       -Cuts a portion of the screen to the clipboard.  After this
                option is selected, position the pointer at the top left
                corner of the area you wish to cut, hold the left button down,
                and drag the box over the region.  When you release the left
                button, the area will have been copied to the clipboard.

Clip [f2]      -Copies the entire screen to clipbard.  You can hold this
                screen in the clipboard area while you load a new palette,
                or you can copy from the clipboard onto another of the screens
                thereby working on your picture in stages.

Paste [f3]     -Copies whatever is on the clipboard onto the current drawing
                screen.  After selecting, the previously cut area will appear
                on the drawing screen.  Move the pointer inside this area and
                hold the left button down.  You can now drag the area to the
                place that you want to put it.  release the button to fix the
                area in place.  You cannot drag the cut region around to give
                a smeared effect, as you can in some of the other drawing
                packages.

Fit Colours [f4]
               -Adjusts the image on the clipboard to best fit the new palette
                thus allowing you to convert an image to a new palette so that
                it looks as presentable as possible.



                DRAW
                ====

Draw           -Draw with the currently selected brush, in the currently
                selected colour.  Hold the left button down to draw.

Drizzle        -Sprays pixels of the selected colour over a small region.
                Hold left button down to drizzle.

Spray          -The best spray function I've ever seen in an art package! Just
                like dropping an atom bomb on your canvas.  A bit too vicious
                to be of much use generally, but great to play with.

Flood          -Fill.  Fills an area with the currently selected colour.  Be
                careful that any area you wish to fill is completely enclosed,
                otherwise the fill may "leak" and cover areas that you didn't
                want to be filled.  Place the pointer over the area you wish
                to fill and then click the left button.

Lines          -Draws a line in the selected colour.  Place the pointer where
                you want the line to begin and drag the line out to where you
                want it to finish.  Release the left button to "fix" line.

Polygon        -Draws a multi-sided shape in the selected colour.  The shape
                will automatically be filled if the Filled option is selected.
                Click left button where you want the first corner of the
                polygon to start, then drag the lines out, clicking left buton
                to fix them in place.  Right button terminates and the shape
                will be automatically completed, filled if specified.

Rays           -Draws lines from a single origin.  Rays can be used to set
                perspective lines.  Position the pointer where you want the
                origin to go, then drag each line out and fix it by clicking
                the left button.  Hold left button and move the mouse around
                for a "sweep" effect.

Circle         -Draws circle, filled if the Filled option is selected.  Click
                the left button where you want the centre of the circle, then
                drag the circle out to the desired radius.  Fix the circle by
                releasing the left mouse button.

Box            -Draws a rectangular shape, filled if the Filled option is
                selected.  Move the pointer to where you want the top left
                corner of the circle to start, then drag the box out and fix
                it in place by releasing the left button.



                MISC
                ====

Status [Space] -Displays how many frames have been drawn, current frame number
                and memory left.

Zero Clear     -When things are pasted from the clipboard onto a screen, the
                background colour (colour 0) can be either transparent (so the
                picture underneath shows through), or opaque (so the picture
                underneath is completely obscured by the pasted block).  Zero
                clear setting makes colour 0 transparent.

Filled         -This option dictates whether the shapes drawn on the screen
                will be automatically filled.  If the option is ticked, then
                the shapes will be filled.

Neo            -Selects the type of picture file to be loaded.  NEO is used
                for Neochrome pictures, otherwise DEGAS format is selected.

Zoom [Z]       -Toggles zoom option.  When zoom is selected, move the zoom
                window over the area that you wish to magnify, then press the
                left button.  All drawing operations work in zoom mode.  To
                return to normal picture editing, click on zoom again or
                press Z.

    N.B. If you have filled all available memory with pictures, then there will
not  be  enough  room  for the clipboard.  So if Cut and Paste do not work, try
deleting one of the frames.



                FRAMES
                ======

Go Foreward [Right Arrow]
               -Moves to the next "frame" or drawing screen.  This now becomes
                the current drawing screen.  This, if you want to use this
                next screen to modify the work on earlier drawing screens, you
                should first take the previous screen to the clipboard using
                the "clip" option, and then paste it to your new screen.  Thus
                you can construct your work in stages.

Go Backward [Left Arrow]
               -Moves to the previous "frame" or drawing screen.

Goto First [Up Arrow]
               -Moves to the first "frame" or drawing screen (frame 1).

Goto Last [Down Arrow]
               -Moves to the last "frame" or drawing screen.  This refers to
                the last screen in the sequence, so if you have only been
                one screen, this option will have no effect.

Append [Clr]   -Places the current drawing screen into the sequence of frames.
                The frame counter is incremented to the next frame.

Insert [Insert]-Places the current drawing screen into the sequence of frames,
                Different from Append in that the frame counter is not
                incremented.  Thus if you are at frame 3 and you insert, the
                screen will be placed in the sequence and all frames after it
                will be incremented -but you will still be at frame 3.

Delete [Delete]-Deletes the current frame from the sequence.

Play Foreward [f8]
               -Plays the sequence one frame after another, starting with the
                first frame and displaying each screen in the sequence in an
                endless loop.

Play Backward [f9]
               -Same as forewards, only in reverse.

Play Fast [f10]-Sets play speed to fast.

Play Slow [f7] -Sets play speed to slow.



                BRUSH
                =====

    Here you will find a selection of brush shapes.  Whichever shape you select
will be used with the drawing functions.



                COLOUR
                ======

    This contains the colour palette.  Whichever colour is selected will be the
colour  that  is  used by the drawing functions.  There does not seem to be any
way  in which to set the RGB values and hence to define the palette, but if you
load  a  picture  then  Flicker will adopt the palette that goes with it.  This
means that you may have to use another package to set up the palette, then save
a  "blank" picture so that you can load its palette into flicker by using "Load
Pic".




And Now!
========

    Here's  a mention about the greatest Atari ST publication in existence.  It
is  called  ST  NEWS  and tells you just about everything you ever want to know
about the world of ATARI ST.  This disk magazine is Public Domain and should be
read  by  every ST enthusiast everywhere.  It produced in Holland and should be
in  most  PD  libraries  since  it already has a massive readership.  If you've
never seen it, get it -you'll be glad you did.
