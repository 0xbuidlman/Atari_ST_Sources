SetKey is a utility written by Holger
Schmidt from Hamburg, Germany, for
editing and creating *.ckb files for
use in conjunction with CKBD.

To get a (mostly) English version of
SetKey replace the original setkey.rsc
with the setkey.rsc from this directory.

What the file spdchar.map is for is
desribed in the manual (Tips&Tricks).

Setkey_e.hyp is SetKey's manual which
can be read using the ST-Guide
hypertext system. If you haven't got
ST-Guide but you feel that you
desperately need a normal manual text,
