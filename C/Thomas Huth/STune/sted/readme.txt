
  STED - The STune Level Editor
  =============================

We finally decided to release the level editor of STune, too, so that
everybody can create his own levels!
Using the editor should be quite easy since it's a normal GEM program.
You just have to know that you have to press the right mouse button or
space to select a ground tile or building or unit. Then you can place it
on the battle field with the left mouse button.
However, the editor is very instable, I never really debuged it. So you
better don't use it with a multitasking OS and don't forget to save
regularly your level.
Of course this version of the editor is restricted so that you can't edit
the campaign level files (it would be too easy then, wouldn't it?), but
STune now features a new main menu button that lets you load your self-made
levels.
