Help about 32 bits compiler Borland C++ 4.0 or 4.5 :

For example...
To compile GLCB samples, you need the following files
(you don't need to install all the 22 or 28 disks!!!)

\BIN\MAKE.EXE
\BIN\32RTM.EXE
\BIN\BCC32.EXE
\BIN\BRCC32.EXE
\BIN\TLINK32.EXE
\BIN\WORKOP32.W32
\BIN\WINDPMI.386
\BIN\RLINK32.DLL
\BIN\IMPDEF.EXE
\BIN\IMPLIB.EXE

\EXAMPLES\MAKEFILE.GEN
\EXAMPLES\EXEMPLE.C
\EXAMPLES\WING.H     (copy it into ..\include)
\EXAMPLES\WING.C
\EXAMPLES\NOCURSOR.RC
\EXAMPLES\MAKEFILE
\EXAMPLES\HEADER.H   (copy it into ..\include)
\EXAMPLES\M.BAT      
\EXAMPLES\WING32BC.LIB (copy it into ..\lib)

\INCLUDE\*.*
\INCLUDE\SYS\*.*

\LIB\C0W32.OBJ
\LIB\IMPORT32.LIB
\LIB\CW32.LIB
\LIB\C0D32.OBJ
\LIB\C0X32.OBJ
\LIB\CW32I.LIB


First add the following line in SYSTEM.INI after [386Enh]:
(and copy \BIN\windpmi.386 to c:\windows\system)

[386Enh]
device=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\windpmi.386
...


M.BAT content:
-------------

path=..\bin
make >err.txt
(so, errors can be read from err.txt)

type in 'm' in order to compile your programs


WING32BC.LIB is a correct library in order to call WING32.DLL
You can build it with the command :

implib -c wing32bc.lib wing32.dll


MAKEFILE content:
----------------

BCROOT = c:\? (<- put here your BC++ directory)
BCBINDIR      = $(BCROOT)\bin
BCINCDIR      = $(BCROOT)\include
BCLIBDIR      = $(BCROOT)\lib

MODEL = f
EXE = exemple
OBJEXE = exemple.obj wing.obj
RESEXE = nocursor.res
LIBEXE = wing32bc.lib

!include makefile.gen





Enjoy 32 bits !!!

PS: You don't need to install Win32s in order to compile
(you only need windmpi.386 in your windows system directory)

But in order to execute 32 bits programs, you must install
Win32s on Win3.1 (with last disk of BC++), or run it under
Windows 95 or Windows NT.

Why 32 bits programs ?
Well... Adresses are linear (no segmentation), automatic datas
are no longer limited to 64Ko... So, now you can program with
no limits (like on a Atari 520 ST! Wonderful!).
Caution : strangely... if you compile with less of 8 Mo of ram,
compilation will be very long (disk swapping because of memory lack).

I have a question: 32 bits compilations is fast on an Atari 520 ST!
(0.5 Mo!). So where is the problem with Intel 386 architecture ?

Think about it!
