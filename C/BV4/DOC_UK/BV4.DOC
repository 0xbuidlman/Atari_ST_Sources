Bitmap View IV - Main documentation

You have just installed Bv4 on your computer. Congratulations! You will
discover a handy GEM program working thanks to the constantly evolving
ME moduls.

The interface of this program has been conceived to be the simpliest as
possible, avoiding you the reading of any documentation. This documenta-
tion will content itself with explaining the function of each menu and
each dialogbox. Be reassured, lot of the users of Bitmap View IV rarely
read this documentation even if I recommend them to read it once. It may
be usefull even if the use of Bv4 is so easy.

In case of problem, you may also read the file BV4.FAQ which recollects
the solutions to most of the most frequent problems.


INTERNAL MANAGEMENT OF THE PICTURES
-----------------------------------
Internally, Bv4 stores its pictures either as screen format or as VDI
pictures. So, it is possible to handle pictures which have a number of
colors (or bitplanes) different from the current resolution. Such
pictures are not displayed but their windows contain a grey raster.


LOADING PICTURES
----------------
Through the 'Load' menu-entry, you can load one or several pictures by an
easy way. If you simply click on one file, it is loaded as normally, but
if you type a mask - such as 'IMG*.GIF' - as filename, all pictures 
conformable to the mask are loaded.
If you own an alternative fileselector like Selectric (or Freedom), you
can directly select several files by all the ways available in Selectric;
for exemple, by clicking with the SHIFT-key down. It is also possible to
set Selectric's default directories and extensions in the 'Options' menu.


GENERATE PICTURES
-----------------
The RIM moduls enable you to generate pictures i.e. create pictures without
loading. For exemple, you can create fractal landscapes or textures. It
is also possible to drive scanners or digital cameras and send the result
directly into Bv4.
Simply install the needed moduls in the RIM folder in order to let them 
be recognized.


SAVING PICTURES
---------------
The saving option is done thanks to the WIM moduls. It suffices to select
the module corresponding to the desired picture format.


SLIDESHOW
---------
The slideshow option let you display the pictures of a folder one after
the other. The following options are available:

- Pause: Activate the delay (in seconds) between the pictures.

- Loop: The slideshow is indefinitely repeated.

- Recursivity: The underfolders inside the selected folder are read too.

- Shrink: Reduce the displayed picture if it is larger than the screen.
          (available in the next version of Bv4)

- Enlarge: The contrary of the 'Shrink' option. The picture is enlarged
           if it is smaller than the screen.
           (available in the next version of Bv4)           

- Display name: The filename is dispayed on top of screen.

- LEDPanel: Deactive this utility.

- TurboVeille: Deactive this screen saver.

- Path: To select the folder in which the slideshow begins.

- Shrink image: If the picture is larger than the screen, then it will
  be shrinked to fit the screen.

- Grow image: If the picture is smaller than the screen, then it will
  be growed to fit the screen.

Once the slideshow is running; you must keep pressed on the following
keys to stop it: SHIFT, CONTROL or ALTERNATE.
                     

CONVERSION
----------
This option enable you to convert one or several pictures without showing
them. This is a "blind" conversion in order to have no loss. You can
convert a 24-bit TGA picture into a 256-color GIF even if Bv4 runs in
a monochrom resolution.
You must at first set - in the 'ME Moduls' dialogbox from the menu - the
default WIM module which will be used to save.
You have to set the source directory and the destination one; they must be
different.
Then set the color reduction via the popup menu:

- For the best via WIM:
     Bv4 proposes to the WIM not to change the number of colors. If the
     WIM refuses, the file is not converted.

- X colors:
     Bv4 imposes a number of colors to the WIM. If the WIM refuses, the
     file is not converted.
     

FULL SCREEN
-----------
Full screen mode. To change the displayed picture, press the left mouse
button, the W-key or the space bar.
To escape, press the right mouse button or the ESC-key.


MOSAIC
------
Change the sizes and the positions of the windows in order that all windows
become visible. The algorithm is very simplist and works very badly.


PRINTING (GDOS)
---------------
The GDOS printing will work only if there is a GDOS driver available. Bv4
converts the picture into a monochrom picture on the harddisk and starts
the printing with the GDOS driver selected in the menu.
The dialogbox displays also the size of the picture (in pixel) and of the
page (in cm).


PRINTING (WIM)
--------------
The printing by WIM is reserved for the printers that have no GDOS driver,
especially the color printers. As for the saving, it suffices to select
the right WIM.
Of course, it is possible to do some "blind" printing of the pictures that
have more colors than the current resolution.


RESIZING
--------
This option enable you either to resize the current picture or to create
a new copy with a different size.
Use the popup menu to select the way you want to change the size of the
picture. You can either select a predifined size, a zoom factor, or enter
the new size, or enter the width or the height and let Bv4 calculate the
other dimension according to the aspect ratio of the picture.


LOG
---
This dialogbox displays the characteristics of each picture. Click on the
picture number to activate its window.


OPTIONS
-------

- Selectric¿: To activate/deactivate and set the pathes and extentions
              of Selectric.
              
- Load as icons: The picture are directly iconified at loading.

- Impose a global palette: Bv4 uses the system palette to convert
                           the pictures.
                           
- Number of windows: To select the maximal number of windows. This option
                     is activated for the next starting.
                     
- At closing: To set what happends to a picture of which you close its
              window.

- Raster: Enable you to choose the color reduction you want.
          In 'Automatic', Bv4 always converts the picture into the current
          resolution.
          With 'Ask', Bv4 asks you if you want to convert the picture or
          keep it just as it is.


ME MODULS
---------
This dialogbox allows you to set the handling of the ME moduls. If an
element is active, it is loaded from the PARX.SYS folder, otherwise from
Bv4's folder. This enables you to keep to versions of a module; one for
Bv4 and the other for the programs that do not support the same version.
This can be set for each kind of module.

The 'Configuration' button opens another dialogbox from which you can
load or remove any RIM/WIM/IFX module or configure it.


MEMORY
------
Enable you to modify the memory handling. The left part affects the
current settings. You can here change the amount of allocated memory,
although it depends on your system (multitasking environment, ACC, ...)
The right part affects the initialisation of Bv4. You can set the amount
of memory which will be allocated by Bv4 at the next starting. The 
maximal value is 95 % to leave some space for the system.

INTERFACE
---------
- Flashing popup: Activate/deactivate the flashing of the selected entries
                  in the menues.

- Save lib configuration: I recommend to leave this option active in order
                          that all parameters are automatically saved when
                          you quit Bv4.
                          
- Center dialogbox: To set the position of the dialogboxes at their
                    openings.
                    
- Language: You may change one more time the language used in Bv4. Click
            hereunder. (Active at the next starting.)
            
- Desktop: To change the color and the raster of the desktop.


ICONIFICATION
-------------
During the iconification, the icons may be automatically ranged on the
border of the screen in the way you prefer.
To iconify a window; just close it with the CONTROL key pressed.


THE LAST WORDS
