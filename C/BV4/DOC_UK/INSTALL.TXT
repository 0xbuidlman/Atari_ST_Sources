BEWARE:

You must own the complete PARX.SYS folder from PARX (ME moduls) to
run Bv4.
If you have obtained Bv4 from FTP or BBS you must also download the
file PARXSYS.ZIP

There is two step to install properly Bv4:

- Run PARX.SYS\INSTALLA.PRG to install the PARX.SYS folder

- Run BV4\INSTALLA.PRG to install Bv4.
