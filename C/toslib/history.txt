 -Rewritten, based on mintlib and old (non-public) TOS.LIB by 
  Philipp Donze (Philipp Donze at gmx dot ch)

13/10/2004
 -Removed bugs in: Fchmod(),Ffstat64(),Setscreen(),Protobt(),Fgetdta()

14/10/2004
 -Mshrink() takes now 3 arguments (like original library). The first 
  argument should be 0.
 -Removed bug in Fmidipipe(), Prenice()
 -Modified Mxalloc() binding for compatibility with old libraries: 
  Result is returned in A0 and D0!

15/10/2004
 -Corrected non functional Pvfork() implementation.
 -added old gemdos(...), bios(...) and xbios(...) functions which
  are NOT REENTRANT. The prototypes are only defined in TOS.H if the
  macro NO_MULTITHREADING is defined.
  These functions should only be used to implement missing functions
  for testing. If a new system call is defined, it should be 
  implemented with its own assembler module and NOT with a macro which
  maps the new function onto these NON REENTRANT functions!

18/10/2004
 -Modified binding for Super() call so that it doesn't crash when this
  call is used to set your own supervisor stack pointer. 

11/02/2006
 -Added EACCES and EPERM as synonym for EACCDN in "syserr.h"
 -renamed "syserr.h" to "errno.h" (replacing Pure C's original file)
 -renamed "sysvar.h" to "sysvars.h" (as in mintlib)
 -Cleaned up header files

12/02/2006
 -Added LGPL license text to every file.
 -Modified Mshrink() and Frename() to omit "0-argument" necessary in original
  Pure C PCTOSLIB.LIB
 -Added "cookie.h" and routines to read/add/remove cookies.
