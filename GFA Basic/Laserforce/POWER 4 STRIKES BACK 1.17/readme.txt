Power 4 Strikes Back
====================

February 26, 2005

This program is now free for use, modification, code source reviewing, whatever you want.
The READ.ME file should be considered obsolete.

Permission is granted to anyone to distribute this piece of [crap] software by any appropriate
mean, but it should remain absolutely free.

The source code (.GFA/.LST/.BAK files) has been written in GfA Basic 3.5/3.6 for Atari ST.
As I don't have it anymore, you should perhaps distribute the source code in a .LST (ASCII readable)
file.


If you like, use or modify this program, please let me know by dropping an email to lst@laserforce.org


This software runs smoothly on 8 MHz STF/STe machines (including MegaSTe), probably not on TT/Falcon.
Works almost correctly with the latest STeem engine.

This software is distributed as is, and includes NO WARRANTY at all. Do what you want with this.


Have fun,
