Patches to the program Free GEM (labelled 2.1b)
===============================================


*	Cleaned up the handling of GEM windows
	(only one GEM window handle created at a time)

*	Use of WIND_CALC to determine window sizes
	(fixes positioning problems whenever the GEM window border is <>1, eg. XaAES)
	
*	Window title placed in a static buffer (INLINE)

*	Speeded up (a lot) the updating/redrawing of the "diodes" that indicates used RAM
	(updating IBOX hosting the CICONs rather than drawing them one by one)

*	The "diodes" are set correctly already before opening the GEM window
	(used to be unset at startup, updated only after @update was polled first time)

*	Now Free GEM will detect real window shading too, and enter the "idle mode"
	
*	Free GEM is now truly idle when window is shaded
	(no timer events ordered in evnt_multi unless window is "fully open")
	


If you have any thoughts regarding the changes, please get in touch.
