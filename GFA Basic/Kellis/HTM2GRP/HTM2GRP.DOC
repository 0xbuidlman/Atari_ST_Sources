HTM2GRP
FREEWARE
kellis@leading.net

Only the file .prg is relevant.
The .GFA(gfa one) and .LST(ascii) is the src of this program.

This little prog (10k) will first start asking you 3 paths with the fileselector
if the $HOME/htm2grp.inf or current_dir/htm2grp.inf hasn't been found. 
As in the *first run time*.

It will then create the inf file for you for later, without asking the paths 
anymore.

What does that do?
It just creates a THING grp file for you. Which you are more than welcome
to put in your taskbar for submenu :)
WARNING, Taskbar doesn't support scrolling menu, so long list going over the
desktop area will ,maybe, crash or not show completely.

It converts your hotlist.htm (cab) or lynx_bookmark.htm into thing GRP.

Don't forget to reinit TASKBAR to take effect with new changes by clicking on 
the START button holding SHIFT key.

Tell me what you think.
Version 0.2 now doesn't overwrite your saving of your preferences 
when updating your GRP file. As in, you can set icons, colors, 
window position, fonts to your GRP, and everytime you run htm2grp, 
this won't be lost :)
Thanks to lp to help me sorting the little stupid problem I had :)

HTM2GRP came from the Atack converter for their FTP hotlist.

Known bug: Only the @ character is remaped to @64
All non ascii characters should be theorically remaped (following the
THING.HYP)
