Needs a new MiNT kernel (1.14.6 and up) to work efficiently. And most 
likely a recent AES.
MiNTsetter is a GEM program that will report various information 
about your kernel (settings, configurations), and your environment.
You can also adjust few parameters such as TIMESLICE and SECURITY.

This data can be dumped in the clipboard, to facilitate troubleshootings.
If you click on the top middle icon, another window will open 
giving you more info about your kernel.

The GEM side of MiNTsetter was important to me, so in result, you 
have the possibility to "win-shade" MiNTsetter window by clicking on 
the FULLER window gadget.

If the AVSERVER is set but the AVSERVER is not running, the line 
AVSERVER will be grayed out, click on it, it will give you a little 
info.

CTRL q to quit, CTRL c to cut into the clipboard, CTRL i for credits
TAB key for the extra information window.

VFAT and Write-back cache added, so you can now set and use it on the fly.
ONLY new kernel (1.15 and newer).
Force FASTLOAD will bypass the programs flags, always considering it 
to load it without clearing the RAM. (if not set, then the flags will 
be interpreted).

Now incorporate the famous ALERT.ACC within. So no need anymore of 
ALERT.ACC.
The default will be read from the environment variable ALERT if found
Otherwise, the default will be NO.

Add this in your mint.cnf:
setenv ALERT YES

To automatically start MiNTsetter with BUS-ERROR recognition enabled.


What's new: GEM fix, windows were leacking through, Thanks OZK for 
reporting that one.
Dump Cookie jar into clipboard.
Supports unix 'uptime'. (load and uptime)
Use less RAM, (internal reorganization)
Now updates in live the changes for VFAT to the AVserver (if set and running) 
for the concerned partitions. (example, open drive A, and change its VFAT 
status, your AVSERVER will make update the partition directly). Thanks to 
Christian Felsch for this idea. Same applies for the clipboard dumps.
MiNTsetter is able with just 1 mouse-click to suspend inetd (that's what's
in charge for the incoming connections). Handy if you are on the net, but 
don't want to be bothered for a few minutes because you need maximum CPU 
power. So no user can access your computer.
Now checks the real state of the process inetd. (stopped or running). 

The Green mean monster icon in the middle is to dump the cookies installed 
into the clipboard.
The file cookie.dat must reside in the same directory where MiNTsetter is.
This file is only an ASCII file, LF must be used. pico did the job very 
well. So if you want to edit/add more cookie entries, please make sure of 
the END OF LINES.
The maximum entry is of 1000 cookies. If you think this should be 
bigger, email me. So far the original cookie.dat file contains like 
380 of them. This original file was borrowed from cookie_monster 
program.
Thanks to Martin-Eric for this idea.
Version 2.6 and up are now controlling all the partition features with 
the new way of doing Dcntl() instead of using Ssystem().
If N_AES is detected, It will use an extra popup, (in the VFAT window, 
click on the DRIVE letter, (the one between < and >). A popup will appear 
for you to choose easily which drive you want to set.
Same in the main window for SECURITY.
User option also has been added. Giving you information about your logged 
users. (a simple "who" command).
Few routines changed, more efficient, and some button don't leak through 
anymore. More GEM keyboard shortcuts, like CNTRL U, HELP key, Arrows and 
SHIFT Arrows. 
Now is fully installable on minix or FAT.
2.8 will also dump the cookies WITH HEX values.
2.9 has read label in the Vfat window (or will display 
FLOPPYDISK/HARDDRIVE) if the partition doesn't have a label.
3.0 just basically update the opcodes that newer MiNT kernel will support.
3.1 only has a bug fix under Wdialog.
3.2 has a new option called SYNC TIME Filesystem, which sets in seconds 
how often your filesystem will be synced. By default, sync time is every 
5 sec.
3.3 redone some routines if the AES is not used by root, added some entries 
in cookie.dat, dump in the clipbrd the sync-time value added, also few 
bugfixes, nothing bad..

3.4 now use scrp_read() to get the correct clipboard path.
Doesn't evaluate anymore $CLIPBRD environment variable.
Dumps in clipboard $HOME and checks for mint.cnf possible locations.
Hopefully this will change, only 1 location possible for mint.cnf to 
be loaded from. Not like today, same dir as mint.prg, multitos/mint.cnf
and mint/mint.cnf. MiNTsetter checks the same order as MiNT kernal.

Double click on the "Load average" button will copy a "uptime" command 
line like into the clipboard, Great for cut and paste..
Fixed SYNC TIME dump in clipboard, the value was not correct. (was bypassed)

3.5 Has finally fixed the TTram problem (shame on me, passing some 
arguments to GEMDOS with no \0). Anyway, VFAT and Suspend inetd now 
work well even from TTram.
3.5 Adds in real time debug_level and debug_device, changeable from 
the general settings icon. (first one on top).  "latest MiNT kernal 
needed"
3.5 now will open VFAT default drive not A:\ anymore (very annoying 
if you don't have a floppy inserted), but with your BOOT drive 
(most likely C:\)

3.6 Has control over the filesystem cache (in percent), click on the 
horizontal bar to change the value.
3.6 Dumps all the errors generated by the kernal into the file 
/tmp/alert.log
3.6 is more flexible for people not running MiNTos. (no /etc/utmp for 
example)
3.6 few little bug fixes.

3.7 One small bug fix for people using old kernal with 3.6
(the Cache control object was covering the OK button) Fixed now.
3.7 Has full reports of your machine CPU.
3.7 cookie.dat updated some more.

3.8 Two little inconsistencies in the clipboard dump if you use an 
older kernel not supporting the new calls. Now fixed.
3.8 Now also dumps the extra results in the clipboard, such as 
Compiler name, Kernel name, Compiler definitions, etc.

3.9 Has a new icon in the main window, a CPU icon. Which will open a 
new windows with all the CPU caches handled by MiNT kernel. From 
there you can make some changes in real time.
3.9 Has the rsc slightly modified in order to fit more icons without 
changing the design too much, Hence the Cookie and Clipboard icons 
are very close together, and have been edited.


P.S: I was wondering about adding bubbleGEM support, very easy to do, but 
seeing the simplicity of MiNTsetter, is it worth the extra RAM that 
bubbleGEM routines would take? email me to answer this question.
Thanks Martin ;)

Any lost data or damages created by MiNTsetter are on your own.
It's a *freeware*, YOU take the risk.

Thanks.
