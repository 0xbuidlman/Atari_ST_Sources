Lonny,

	I put this together in about 30 minutes, so its not great but it works.
Please don't give it away. If you think it could be useful I can add more
options to it and make it more useable, then I will give it to STIS users.

	Quick docs: the program opens a 512x512 window and fills it with the
			 pattern, you can move it but not size it.

			 SPACEBAR or right click to make a new pattern.

			 Left/Right arrow keys change the pattern size (32x32 to
			 256x256).

			 Up/Down arrow keys change the number of lines that are
			 drawn (4 to 300).

			 S key or menu entry will save the pattern as a TPI file.

			 Q key or window close box to quit.
