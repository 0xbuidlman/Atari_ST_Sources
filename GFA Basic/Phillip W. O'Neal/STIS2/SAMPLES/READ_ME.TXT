    The file CAD_2.TIF is two CAD 3-D objects that were converted to STIS
by a program that Lonny Pursell is working on.
    The file WHEEL_16.TPI is a 16 color image that may make the color use
options in STIS clearer to you. Run STIS and convert this file, then change
the VDI option and convert it again to see the difference, then try the same
thing with the RGB option.
