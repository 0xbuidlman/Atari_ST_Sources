About the program,
	I wanted to be able view and edit any files; with a falcon, TT or ST; 
in any rez; in windows as ASCII characters, HEX, or Graphics; load many files 
at once... needless to say I could not find a program that would do all this, 
so I made one that will do all this and much more.

Windows........................................................................

	The window title will display the file name and size. The infoline 
displays the type(ASCII, HEX, or Graphics) of display, view position, and width 
of the window in characters(ASCII or HEX) or pixels(Graphics). When a window is 
sized the display is changed to take advantage of the size of the window.
	When a new window is opened its window size, display type, and font size 
will be set using the settings from the option dialogs.
	The window up/down arrow gadgets or the up/down cursor arrow keys move  
the display up/down one line fo data. Above/below the window slider gadget or 
the Up/down+control keys move the display up/down one window height of data.  
The window up/down arrow gadgets+shift or the up/down+shift cursor arrow keys 
move the display up/down one byte. The CirHome key moves to the beginning and 
CirHome+shift to the end of the display.
	Double click on the ASCII or HEX data to edit them, the cursor keys move
the cursor, the Esc key exits the edit mode and any other key will change the 
data.
	When a window is closed and it was modified by an edit, a merge, replace, 
insert, delete or bit change you will be notified and will have an opportunity 
to save the file.
	The 'HELP' key will display a table of keys and their use for the edit  
and cursor keys.
 The 1,2,3 keys will change the top windows display to ASCII,HEX, and
GRAPHICS.

Dialogs.........................................................................

	In the right top corner of each dialog is a move gadget, press and hold 
the left mouse button while over the move gadget to grab the dialog box, move 
the mouse until the dialog box is where you would like it to be, release the 
left mouse button to drop the dialog box.

 'Find ASCII/HEX' field - enter the ASCII text or HEX values to find. The HEX 
bytes may be separated by any characters except the hex digits(0 to F).
 'Replace' field - same as find field. 
 'Start at' field - the search or replace will begin at this byte.
 'Case sensitive' button - may be selected to match the upper or lower case 
letters in the find string.

 'All windows' button - same as 'Goto' for all windows.

Copy___________________________________________________________________________
 'to' field - name of window to copy to, if this window does not exist a new 
window will be opened.
 'at' field - if the copy is to another window the data is inserted at this 
byte.
 'Pick' button - select another window to copy to, the name will be placed in 
the 'to' field.
 'Start' field - first byte to copy.
 'End' field - last byte to copy.

Insert_________________________________________________________________________
 'start' field - start inserting here.
 'end' field - stop inserting here.
 'Size' field - this many bytes will be added to the window every 'every' bytes
if the value field is one byte long.

Bit change_____________________________________________________________________
 'Bit Mask' field - binary number used in the AND, OR, and XOR bit operations. 
Any bits not entered will be 0s.
 'Match' field - this binary number is used to test bits in the data to change. 
The data will only be changed if 1s in match are also 1s in the data, 0s are 0s 
in the data, spaces(or any other character) in the match field will be
wildcards and will match either 1s or 0s in the data.  Any bits not entered will 
be treated as spaces.
 'Set' button - sets all bits in the match field to 1.
 'Toggle' button - sets all 1s in match field to 0, and 0s to 1.
 'Clear' button - sets all bits in match field to wildcards.
 'Start' field - first byte to change.
 'End' field - last byte to change.
 'Operation' box - AND; bits in the data are ANDed with the Bit Mask.
                    OR; bits in the data are ORed with the Bit Mask.
                   XOR; bits in the data are XORed with the Bit Mask.
                  Flip; all 1s in the data are changed to 0s and 0s to 1s.
              L/RShift; shift all bits in the data to the right or left.
               Reverse; change the order of the bits in the data.
             L/RRotate; rotate the bits in the data left or right. 

 'Size' box - the bit change can be applied to a byte(8 bits), a word(16 bits) 
or a long word(32 bits).
 'Reset' button - undo all changes made to this dialog since it was opened. 

Prg Options____________________________________________________________________
 'Size' fields - used to set the width and height(pixels) of the display area  
of the windows. The top window will be set to this size if the 'OK' button is 
used to exit this dialog. The size is used when a file is opened or the windows 
are tiled.
 'Min' button - set the size fields to make smallest window possible.
 'Max' button - set the size fields to make a window the size of the screen.
 'Center' and 'Mouse' buttons - if Center is selected all dialogs will be 
centered when the program starts. If Mouse is selected the top left corner of 
the dialog boxes will be at the mouse position.
 'Start=0' button - the find, copy and bit change dialogs start field will 
contain 0 in them when this button is selected, otherwise the start field will 
contain the current view position.
 'Goto=0' button - the goto dialogs goto field will contain 0 if this button   
is selected, otherwise it will contain the current view position.
 '160 column' button - if selected the dumps will be done in 160 columns, 
otherwise 80 columns are used. When dumping to a printer the >80 column mode is 
only for a HP Deskjet.
 'Save' button - save the settings from both option dialogs and the print dialog 
to the file <FILE_SPY.INF>, if this file exist when the program is run the 
setting from  this file will be used.

Pick___________________________________________________________________________

 'All' - sets all windows to the above display mode and font size.

Other Stuff....................................................................

     Most operations only effect the top window.
     If a file is dropped on the file spy icon the program is run and the  
dropped file will load.
     Filename wildcards can be used to open or merge many files at once.
     To enter ASCII characters that can not be typed in hold the ALT key and 
enter a three digit decimal number with the numerical keypad, then release the 
ALT key.

Bugs...........................................................................

     A bug in TOS 4.04 can lock up the computer if more than 15 windows are 
open, TOS 4.04 will return a valid handle even when a window is not available. 
If you have TOS 4.04 then you could use the program WinX.
     On TOS 1.xx the 'Close all' function does not work correctly, yet.
