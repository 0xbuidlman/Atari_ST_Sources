  Stereoscopic vision has been around for about 150 years,  3-D photos with
special lenses or more recently  3-D  movies that requirer special glasses.
This program (STIS_3D.PRG) is used to create 3-dimensional images on the ST
that need no special glasses or anything else to see them in 3-D.

The images can only be seen when viewed in the correct manner.
My best explanation as to the viewing process is as follows:
    Stare at the image as if looking at something twice as far away.  Being
    about  12"  to 16"  from the image works best for me.  Another way some
    people use is to cross your eyes  while  looking  at  the  image,  then
    slowly uncross then until the alignment dots merge together. 

The 3-D images take some people longer to see than others. The first time I
tried it took me about  5  minutes.  Once I learned  how to do it I can see
them in a few seconds.  Others I have shown the  3-D  images  to took weeks
before the could see anything.  It's not easy for everyone,  but it is well
worth the effort when you do see them.  I have included some 3-D images for
you to use while learning to see in  3-D,  the program itself will generate
these images(see the 'DEMO' menu entry in the instructions below).

THE PROGRAM: The program will run in any ST resolution,from any directory,
             and from a hard drive.  The program was written in GFA basic.
             If you have any comments, criticisms, or questions my mailing
             address is near the top of the page,  Please write, I will do
             my best to add or fix anything  that  I  can  or  answer  any
             questions.

WARNING: Once able to see the  3-D  images,  don't  overdo  it.  It is good
         exercise for your eyes but not for prolonged periods of time. Take
         a break from time to time, do something else(I.E. send me a letter
         with comments,  criticisms,  questions, money, ect. to the address
         above).

The letters in the parentheses are keyboard equivalents to each menu entry.

MENU  ENTRY             KEY  DESCRIPTION
----  ----------------- ---  -----------
DESK  STIS                  -Credits.
                            -Desk accessors.

FILE  LOAD PICTURE      (L) -Loads a degas  PI?  picture and sets the color
                             palette.

      SAVE STIS IMAGE   (S) -Save a degas  PI?  compatible STIS  image with
                             the palette from the last  DEGAS  picture that
                             was loaded  or the system palette if no  DEGAS
                             picture was loaded.

      CREATE STIS IMAGE (C) -The  STIS  image is created  using  the  DEGAS
                             picture that was loaded.  Each  color  in  the
                             DEGAS  picture appears to be  at  a  different
                             distance from  the  background,  I  call  them
                             'planes'. If a STIS image is in the buffer you
                             will be informed and can choose to use the old
                             one or a new (blank) buffer to create the STIS
                             image.  After creating the image you are asked
                             if you would like alignment dots (helps you to
                             see 3-D image),  if you do they can be  placed
                             at the top or bottom of the image.

       PRINT STIS IMAGE (P) -Print a STIS image.  Using the system hardcopy
                             routine after checking the online status.

       QUIT             (Q) -Exit the program.

VIEW #                      -'#' is the offset(see 'PLANE' entry below).

      FULL SCREEN VIEW  (W) -Full screen view of the STIS image. Any key or
                             mouse button will exit.

      TOP DEGAS PIC     (D) -Top the DEGAS PICTURE window.

      TOP STIS IMAGE    (I) -Top the STIS IMAGE window

      MAKE NEW BLANK    (N) -Make a new  blank  STIS  buffer  to  use  when
                             creating a  STIS image.  The only time this is
                             needed is when  you  don't  like  the  current
                             random dot background.

      DEMO         (F1-F10) -Press a  function  key  to  have  the  program
                             create one of the  10  STIS image demos.  They
                             are just simple examples of what can  be  done
                             in 3-D,  but they are well worth  looking  at.
                             The demos will each take from a few seconds to
                             a few minutes to create.

      RESTORE COLORS    (R) -The entire palette is restored to  the  values
                             before the program was run. This can be useful
                             for  DEGAS  pictures with  very  low  contrast
                             between the background and text display color.

      PLANE PLUS/MINUS (+-) -If in medium or high rez the  '#'  in the VIEW
                             menu title will  display  a  value(the offset)
                             from  0  to  6, the default is  0.  All of the
                             planes will be raised by this amount.

                   (ARROWS) -Max the sliders.

THE WINDOW

      FULL BUTTON       (F) -Full the active  window.  This  function  will
                             cycle from FIXED SIZED to  USER SIZED to  FULL
                             SIZED then back to  FIXED SIZE (initial size).

      CLOSE BUTTON      (Q) -Exit the program.

The DEGAS window title will show the filename of  the  last  DEGAS  picture
that was loaded.
The STIS window title will show the filename of the degas picture  used  to
create it.                            

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER

                      (ESC)  -The escape key will abort a create operation.

The file 'STIS.ICN' is an icon to use in  NEODESK or with newer versions of
TOS as the icon for 'STIS_3D.PRG'.

When drawing in DEGAS  or another paint program their are a few things that
will help the STIS image come out better.  Try not to use  thin  lines,  as
they are very hard to see in the STIS image.  Small text is  also  hard  to
read, so it should be as large as you have room for. In low rez you have 15
planes(colors without 0) to use,  3-D objects and objects that appear to be
much close or farther away are easy to make with 15 planes.  In medium/high
rez you only have 3/1 planes but more detailed images.  The lack of  planes
can be worked around by merging 2 or more  DEGAS  pictures (use OLD buffer)
with different offset values.  This works well if you  merge  the  pictures
from left to right.  The reason for working from  left  to  right  is  that
sometimes the new image will effect something on it's right,  but not  it's
left.

This program is shareware,  if you use it please send what ever  you  think
it's worth to the address above and you will receive the  next  version  of
STIS and as many images as will fit on the disk.
