The program (STIS.PRG) was used to create the unique 3-dimensional images
(STREOSCOPIC IMAGES) in the STIS_PIX folder. The images can only be seen
when viewed in the correct manner. My best explanation as to the viewing
process is as follows:

   Look at the image as if looking at something twice as far away. Being
   about 12 to 16 inches from the image works best for me.
   It may be easier to be able to see the objects for the first time on a
   printout.


The 3-D images take some people longer to see than others.  The first time I
tried it took me about 5 minutes. Once I learned how to do it I can see most
of them in a few seconds.  Others I have shown the  3-D images to took weeks
before the could see the objects. It's not easy for everyone, but it is WELL
WORTH THE EFFORT when you do see them.

The pix are in DEGAS PI? format because PC?,TN? produced files larger than the
originals (the pix look like a screen full of random dots, but there NOT!).

If anyone is interested I may release STIS.
