      The object of this game is simply to turn the  7  smiley  faces  until
      they are all in the upright position.  This  would  be  an  easy  task
      except that when one face is turned the one on each side of  him  also
      likes to turn in the same direction(they wrap around on the ends too).

      The faces are turned  90  degrees at a time,  the  left  mouse  button
      turns them clockwise,  the right  mouse  button  turns  them  counter-
      clockwise.  As an aid in remembering which way each button  turns  the
      faces the mouse pointer is shaped like two buttons with arrows showing
      the direction each button will turn the faces (the  'HOT-SPOT'  of the
      mouse pointer is in the center/top).

      FILE menu:    NOTE: Below each entry is a letter in parenthesis,  this
                    is the  keyboard equivalent to each dropdown menu entry.

      START (S)     Start a new game,  each face  will  start  in  a  random
                    position  (upright,  upside-down,  or laying one of it's
                    sides).  You must select 'START'  before the game can be
                    played.

      RESET TOTALS  Reset the number of games played,  the average number of
      (R)           moves per game, and resets the current game (this is the
                    only way to stop the current game being  played,  except
                    for getting all the faces upright or quitting the game).

      CLOCK (C)     Toggle the clock in the menu title on and off.

      SET TIME (T)  Set the system time.  A dialog box pops up.  Click on an
                    arrow button to change the hour or minute. 'SET' changes
                    the time and exits.  'CANCEL' exits without any changes.

      NOISE (N)     Turn that dumb ding sound (made when you turn the faces)
                    off/on.

      HELP (H/HELP) Only use this after all else fails.

      QUIT (Q)      Exits the program.
     
      The CLOSE WINDOW field (top left corner of window)  can be use to quit
      the program (that makes 3 ways to quit the game, hummm....).  The FULL
      field  (top right)  will change  the size of the window to about  half
      size or back to full screen.  Selecting START or RESET TOTALS from the
      menu or keyboard will also make the window full size.

      The window title line shows  'MOVES:' (how many times you have  turned
      a set of 3 faces in the current game),  'GAMES'  (the number of  games
      played sense the program started or  the  totals  were  reset),  'AVE'
      (average number of moves to complete all games played),  and the system
      time if the clock is on.

      This program was orignally made for ST(E) low rez,  but works fine in
      ST(E) med rez or high rez (it may even work on a TT??).  It  is  also 
      SHAREWARE, If you keep this program please let me know,  I don't want
      any money, just sending me a copy of a  PD or  SHAREWARE program that
      you have made(to the address below) would be payment enough. HAVE FUN
