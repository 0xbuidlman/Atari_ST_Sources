Hi,

This is the sourcecode of my MSX emulator.
It was written in GFA basic and fully emulates a Z80 processor, video-chip
and what else one can found in an MSX1, some of MSX2 an a little of the
MSX Turbo-R.
For history sake I kept the contact information intact in the sourcecode
and documentation altough they no longer work. If you would like to discuss
(whatever you like) with me, use the e-mail address folkert@vanheusden.com.
PGP-key: 1f28d8ae
The .gfa-file is for GFA-Basic 3.6tt, the .lst should also work with older
versions of GFA-Basic.
The emulator is quiet slow. If memory serves me well, it ran at 1% of the
speed of an original MSX (which runs at aprox. 3.5MHz). I once ran the
Atari ST STonX emulator on a pentium 4 at 2.8GHz on full speed, the MSX
emulator then ran at 50% of the speed of a real MSX.
