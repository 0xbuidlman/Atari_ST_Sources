This first attempt to a MSX emulator was done by F.J.J. van Heusden.
You can contact me at: Tournooiveld 11, 4841 VM, Prinsenbeek, The Netherlands.
Or via FidoNet: 2:285/750.2 or UUCP: FvH.p2.f750.n285.z2@fidonet.org

This emulator emulates & supports:
- a maximum of 64Mb MSX-Memory (! 64 Megabyte !)
- memory mappers
- konami SCC and SCC+
- data-recorder using sampler
- data-recorder using diskdrive
- rs232c
- printer port
- full msx-2 vdp! but: vdp-draw commands are not supported _YET_

This emulator his highly configurable and should work on all

Atari STfm
Atari STe
Atari Mega ST
Atari Mega STe
Atari TT
Atari TTx
Atari Falcon 030
Atari Falcon 040
computers with at least 1 meg of memory. It might work as well on ST's
with 0.5Mb memory, but I have not tested that.

If this program does not what you want or it screws up your whole computer,
your environment and all other things you really need (or not), I am NOT
responsible! Use this program at your own risc!
But anyway, there should not be that much risico on using it.

This nice little program is shareware, if you use it or you want some help
from me or you want me to continue working on this project (optimizing etc.)
send me at least 12  dutch guilders or something different from the table
listed below.
