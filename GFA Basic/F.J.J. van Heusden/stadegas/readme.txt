Hi,

This is the sourcecode of STADegas
It was written in GFA basic.
For history sake I kept the contact information intact in the sourcecode
and documentation altough they no longer work. If you would like to discuss
(whatever you like) with me, use the e-mail address folkert@vanheusden.com.
PGP-key: 1f28d8ae
The .gfa-file is for GFA-Basic 3.6tt, the .lst should also work with older
versions of GFA-Basic.
