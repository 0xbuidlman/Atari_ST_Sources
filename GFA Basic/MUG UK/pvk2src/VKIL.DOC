p1. Introduction to Super Virus Killer¿ v1.0q
-------------------------------------------

"We shall go onto the end.  We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the
seas and oceans.  We shall fight with growing confidence and strength in the
air.  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost maybe.  We shall fight
on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds.  We shall fight in the
fields and the streets. We shall fight in the hills - WE SHALL NEVER SURRENDER"

                             Winston Churchill


Oh well, the speech might not be very appropriate, but it is the most
appropriate one I could find (thanks to Iron Maidens' "Live After Death" for
the inspiration !!) for the introduction to this program, 'SVK(tm) v2.0'.


Welcome to the Public Domain version of the 'Super Virus Killer¿ v2.0' by
MUG U.K¿ in 1989.  Written in GFA BASIC v2.0 from March 1989 up until
November 1989.  On November 10th, 1989, the whole program was converted to
GFA BASIC v3.07.  All versions with release dates after that are written
and compiled with this greatly enhanced version of GFA BASIC.  I have just
recently heard that this has been ugraded once again to v3.5 - as soon as I
can afford this version, I will convert this program to this latest issue
of the BEST BASIC available for the Atari ST.

I have decided to release this final version because the main part of it, the
actual virus detection bit, was finished but it is always being updated to
recognise more and more bootsectors.  Also, I have been approached by the
Public Domain firm, Floppyshop ST, who have expressed an interest in releasing
this utility.  If all goes well (with my programming !), look out for a 
commercial release of this program, sometime in the summer months of 1990.
  
You are lucky to be in the possession of a 'preview' version that is fully
functional - most preview version always tend to have a time limit on them,
or the save function disabled - but not here !!!  You have a fully functioning
version.  By releasing this version, I hope that you will purchase the future
comercial version which will be greatly enhanced over this Public Domain
version.

I hope this utility is of some use in its released P.D. state and I hope you
can wait for the full (commercial) version.  If you find that this program
is of any use, please send whatever monetary contributions you can spare to
the address within the program.  What you have here is 11 months of unpaid
coding.  I must of released this program untold numbers of times into the
Public Domain - each has a different release date - and I've had not a single
response in cash terms.  I know this program is not Shareware, but it would be
nice to receive some form of contribution, a letter would be nice to say that
my program has rescued your disk collection even !!


The file list should be as follows:-
------------------------------------

VKIL.PRG        -       The main program file (compacted using Bytekiller)
VKIL.DOC        -       This document file
VKIL.RSC        -       The resource file
MEDIUM.DAT      -       The medium resolution graphics file
MONO.DAT        -       The high resolution graphics file
MEDIUM.FNT      -       The medium resolution font
MONO.FNT        -       The high resolution font
VKIL.INF        -       The saved preferences file

Please do not seperate the files, rename name or change any of the various
bytes by use of some kind of disc-editor program - coz unless you know what
you're doing, you'll probably screw up everything !!!

It won't be too long a wait for the commercial version - I assure you !!


pWhat just may be in the commercial version !!!q
----------------------------------------------

1) The ability to detect most bootsectors and also store the unknown ones
   and arrange for the 'discoverer' to send the bootsectors to me so that
   I can include them into my program.  Full credits will be included into
   the program for those who are most helpful, either in the main program,
   or in an accompanying file.
   
2) The ability to print out and install bootsectors from a preset list.  This 
   function will probably be implemented in the commercial version - mainly
   because of the new Copyright Laws that came into effect in the UK on
   August 1st, 1989.  I am unsure as to whether or not I can keep a library
   of bootsectors from commercial disks - mainly because the law states that
   'no part of this product may be stored, copied, lent or hired in anyway'
   or along similar lines.  I have no wish to get into trouble with my program!
   
3) The possibility of customizing program to suit your own printer.  This is
   when I get around to working out a decent screen-dumping routine, that will
   use proper printer codes.  At the moment, all it does is print a hexadecimal
   dump of the current bootsector being displayed !!

4) Better system variables display option.  To include the variables most 
   likely to be affected should a virus be in memory, and to act upon the
   most suspect values.  At the moment, in this last P.D. version, there are
   a list of the more important system variables that are changed by a resident
   virus.  In the commercial version, there will be a more detailed look at
   these addresses (in what way I am unsure of yet !!).  I have also added a
   'Virus Check' routine at the beginning which recognises a few of the more
   well known viruses and checks the status of the reset-vector, this should
   keep out most viruses (and warn you if your system is already infected!).

5) A 'Scan Bootsector' option.  Will scan an unrecognised bootsector for the
   known symptons of viruses - ie. Writing Sectors, Altering Reset-Vectors
   and other things like that.
   
6) To be fully STE compatible.  Hey! Atari, what the hell did you do ???  Why
   did you have to make my life (and other P.D. programmers) so difficult by
   moving the ROM addresses around ???  I have had to re-write most of my
   ROM-specific code to add STE references - at the moment, if you own an
   STE, and you use this program, the fonts will not work and the routine that
   I am using to detect the status of the write-protect has moved (yet again!)
   and I will have to wait for an STE specific ROM Disassembly Manual to be
   printed !!


p2. How to use this program against viruses.q
-------------------------------------------

Right, here is the section detailing the reason that you have purchased this
program from whichever Public Domain firm that you did.  If you got given this
program, then good for you.  At least it means that the program must be fairly
useful for it to get sent to other people !!!  (Head-swelling of author !!)

Anyway, with this utility loaded, you select the main option of this program.

'Investigate Bootsector' - which is under the 2nd menu bar title of 'Disk'.

or if you are really lazy, press 'Control & E' for the same function.
 
You will now be asked to insert the disk(s) that you wish to examine for the
presence of any known viruses, commercial bootsectors or even the bootsectors
that can be installed by this and other programs.  As many of them that I find
or that I am sent, are added to this program (which is why there are 175 of
them that can be detected !!!).


After the disks' bootsector is loaded in and examined by my program, one of
five occurences will happen and they are detailed below.


pa) Recognised bootsector.q
-------------------------

If the disks' bootsector is recognised, an approriate message will appear
saying something along the lines of;

'This is Disk 1 of Afterburner by Activision' - guess which game you inserted !

This basically means that the disk you inserted contains a bootsector which
has specific code for that game/P.D. demo.  It may just be a loading routine
or even the disk protection - it is just a bootsector that I have come across
before and added it to the library of bootsectors in this program.


pb) Virus on bootsector.q
-----------------------

If you have inserted a disk which has a virus on it, you will be greeted by
a flashing screen in mono or a flashing red screen in colour.  This message
will appear;

"This disk is infected with the 'Signum Virus'" - one of the most common
                                                  virii in the U.K/World !!

This depends on whether or not the disk has the Signum Virus on it, but if
another virus is on the bootsector, then the screen will still flash red, but
a different message shall appear !!

You should then have an alert box in the middle of the screen asking if you
would like to kill this virus - you also have the option of leaving the virus
where it is.  If you leave the virus, it will only spread itself further - I
don't know why I put this option in, but it's now in there and I cannot be
bothered deleting it !!!!


pc) Unrecognised bootsector.q
---------------------------

If you have inserted a disk that has an executable bootsector on it AND it is
a bootsector that is not in my vast library of known bootsectors, then the
screen will also flash (in mono) or flash green (on a colour monitor).  This
means that the bootsector of the disk that you have just inserted is not
recognised by my program.  What you then do, is leave the 'Investigate ..' 
option and then goto the same menu bar where you found 'Investigate ..' and
select the 'Store Bootsector' option.  You will then be greeted by a
message explaining how to use the afore-mentioned option.  All you need is a
blank-formatted disk (or a fairly empty disk) to store the bootsectors on it.
Each file takes up 512 bytes for the actual bootsector, plus a maximum of 150
bytes for the description of the stored bootsector, and its checksum.


The 'Store ...' option requires one line of text describing what game/disk
that this bootsector came from.  For example;

'This is Disk 1 of "Stunt Car" by Microstatus' - or whatever you want to type
                                                 to describe the bootsector
                                                 that you have just stored.

The file will then be saved to disk (please keep the '.B_B' extension because
the other options that can use the stored files look for that extension).  Now
get that blank disk in the post to me as fast as you can, I need bootsectors - 
is there a word to describe an addictiveness to bootsectors ???  Answers on a
postcard to ..........


pd) Non-executable bootsector.q
-----------------------------

"This disk is non-executable, but I cannot call it 100% safe ..."

When the message above appears, it means that the bootsector of the disk
that you have just inserted has some code on it, but it is not been made
executable.  This could be that the checksum exists, but there is no
call made to the code stored in the bootsector.  It is best to store these
bootsectors to a seperate disk, immunize them and if anything fails to work,
restore the bootsector using the 'Load & Install Bootsector'.  Don't forget
to send a copy of the bootsector to me !!!


pe) Clean and/or non-immunized bootsector.q
-----------------------------------------

Finally, if you have inserted a disk that has not got an executable bootsector
on it, you are given the option to rewrite the current bootsector with a 
virus-immunized bootsector.  For the techno-buffs out there, the virus
immunization routine is a simple 'RTS' instruction.  All it does is to jump
to the 'RTS' instruction - therefore it does nothing at all !!!

Basically speaking, it is a 'clean-boot' - it does nothing except make sure
that the bootsector does something and it also acts as a safeguard against
viruses that DO NOT write to executable bootsectors (eg. Signum) !!!

This 'clean-boot' is also used by Richard Karsmakers on his range of Virus
Killing utilities (AVK3.6GB onwards).  It was his utilities that originally
kept everyones' disks free of viruses, so I thought it would be nice to keep
the same immunization method as his programs !!!

If the investigate option discovers the older type of virus immunization
it will offer you the chance to rewrite the bootsector with the newer type
of immunization codes.

DO NOT VIRUS IMMUNIZE ANY COMMERCIAL BOOTSECTORS OR ELSE YOU MAY SCREW UP
YOUR DISKS - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED AND I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU
MANAGE TO WRECK YOUR FAVOURITE SHOOT-EM-UP/STRATEGY GAME !!!

 

p3. Added Extras.q
----------------

There are several other options that I have written into the program, and they
are listed here.  Each function (except for the 'Swap Font') is accessible via
the menu-bar or its associated keyboard command that is displayed alongside it.


p3.1 Display Bootsector.q
-----------------------

This option will display a bootsector/bootsector file on the screen in either
Hexadeciamal or ASCII.  You also have the option to print out the bootsector
for a permenant copy of the bootsector.  It prints out in hexadecimal only for
the moment, this is another option that will be altered in the commercial
version.


p3.2 Examine Bootsectors BPB.q
----------------------------

This option will disect a bootsector (or a bootsector that has been stored
as a file on disk) into how many sides, sectors, tracks, FAT tables etc.

As the method I have used is not foolproof, some bootsectors/files will cause
this program to crash out with a 'Divsion by Zero' error.  As I cannot find
a better way to work out the values (but it will be changed before the 
commercial version appears - I promise !!), you will have to put up with this
slight idiosyncracy (what a wierd word to spell !!!).


p3.3 Set Preferences.q
--------------------

With this option you can set the preferences file to hold your choice of
hertz rate & which colour scheme you require.  Follow the on-screen prompts
and a file will be saved to disk (make sure it is the disk contaning 
'SVK¿ v1.0' !!!).


p3.4 Swap Hertz Rate.q
--------------------

If your TV/Monitor can handle the different hertz ratings, you can swap 
between the two different values with this option.  In monochrome, this
function is disabled on the menu-bar.


p3.5 Internal Vars.q
------------------

This will display a screen showing you how many disks you have checked, and
how many bootsectors were infected/recognised/installed/stored etc.

I just added this routine for the sheer hell of it !!!


p3.6 Bootsector Installation Options.q
------------------------------------

I have included some bootsectors that can be installed onto any of your
disks (preferably onto freshly formatted disks, and NOT onto protected 
disks !!).  They are selectable from the 'Install' menu-heading;

The menu selected by using the cursor keys up and down (or move your mouse)
with Return to select an option.  A brief description is included on each 
installation screen (including any DO NOTS !!).

Here is a list of what bootsectors are available.

a)  'The Rasters & Message Bootsector Intro'.  This neat intro (?) scrolls
    some colour bars onto the screen with a message (you can enter your
    own message thanks to me !!) and after pressing a key, the bars scroll
    back down the screen and the computer continues as per normal !!!
 
b)  'The Bladerunners Intro'.  A bootsector spread on all games cracked by 
    The Bladerunners in Europe.  With my program you can alter the message
    which appears in front of the colour bars !!
   
c)  'The English Anti Virus'.  Be careful as this program spreads onto 
    un-immunized disks like wildfire.  But don't worry as I've included an
    option to delete it - should my virus killer find it !!
    
d)  'Medway Boys Bootsector'.  A simple bootsector that checks memory for any
    virii or reset-proof programs.  If any are found, the bootsector will
    refuse to continue until the machine is clear !!
    
e)  'NeoChrome Picture Booter'.  Place a NeoChrome format picture into the
    root directory of your disk, tell my program its filename and you
    can even enter a simple message such as "Now Booting My Program" etc.
    
f)  'Turn Off Drive B:\'.  A nice bootsector utility that was written by
    The Medway Boys (originally for their compacted disks !!).  It simply
    switches off Drive 'B:\' when booted.  It is intended for cracked games
    that try to access a second disk !!! 
    
g)  'Mega Colour Bars'.  The story behind this one is interesting.  I found 
    this bootsector on a disk.  Don't know who gave it to me or which game
    it was from - I wish I knew.  What it originally did was scroll the
    colour bars and print the message 'Please insert other disk and reboot'.
    I gave it to Merlin, who removed the reset-proof code and added a press
    any key to continue patch, allowing you to use it on your disks.  Hence the
    two 'Coded by' messages !!!


p3.7 Swap Font.q
--------------

This function was included because my dad complained that the font could
not be read properly (he's getting old !!).  So, by pressing 'Control & F',
an alert box will appear and you have the option of selecting between the
system font and the defined one that I use in this program.  Until I work out
where to put the font on STEs', I am afaid that STE owners will have to put
up with the system font anyway !!


p3.8 Credits Alert Box.q
----------------------

This is a function that I put in for the sheer hell of it !!  If you press
the 'HELP' key when you're on the main screen, an alert box will appear telling
you who wrote this life-saving program (as if you hadn't already guessed by
now eh ??).  It does nothing else except that (yet more byte-wasting !!)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               See you in the commercial version of this program !!

                          pVIRUSES RECOGNISED:q
                          -------------------

                          
ACA Virus    - A bootsector virus that was written by ACA of Sweden.  I don't
               know exactly what happens as I have been (un)lucky enough not
               to come across it - yet !!


Ghost Virus  - A bootsector virus that spreads rapidly.  When executed it
               reverses the 'Y' direction of your mouse pointer.  It can also
               destroy executable bootsectors and make a disk unbootable after
               a certain number of times.  But, once it is destroyed, your disk
               is once again safe.  Unless of course that bootsector used to
               hold any specific data - from a commercial game for example.
               This also ignores the virus-immunized bootsector and the
               Anti-Virus.  It can also totally damage a MSDOS/IBM formatted
               disk - so beware of using PC-Ditto without switching the machine
               off for about 30 seconds.


Kobold #2    - This virus was sent to me by Steve Delaney at Floppyshop, after
               someone else sent it to him - nice of the sender wasn't it !!!
               I've yet to have this virus 'disected' by Merlin, but according
               to 'AVK 3.6' by Richard Karsmakers, this virus becomes active
               after a second-reset (message 'KOBOLD #2 AKTIV' appears) and
               then proceeds to copy itself to Drive 'A:'.  Further details
               will be available after Merlin disassembles it for me !!!


Mad Virus    - Similar to the Ghost Virus, as it does no harm to your disks
               except that after a certain no. of copies it messes up your
               screen display and plays around with the sound chip.


Pirate Trap  - This virus is on of the latest ones that I have come across.
               I found it on a shop copy of 'Sporting Triangles' by CDS
               Software (absolute panic spread when I rang this firm to let
               them know of the existance of this virus on their product !).
               I have not yet had any of my 68000 friends near this program
               but according to the George Woodsides program ('Vkiller'),
               this virus copies itself 50 times, before displaying the message
                
                            * Pirate Trap *
                        * Youre being watched *
                           * (C) P.M.S. 87 *

               Some person, somewhere (P.M.S ?) has got a sick sense of humour
               by naming this virus 'a pirate trap'.  If anyone knows this
               P.M.S. - go round and kill them !!!


Signum Virus - This virus copies itself a rapidly and after a certain condition
               certain condition the 'key' is set which makes the infected disk
               impossible to access unless the disk is virus killed.  This virus
               is probably the most widespread in the world !!!


Fun Virus    - This virus is very harmless.  It CANNOT spread itself onto other
               disks and all it does upon booting is screw-up the screen
               display, play around with the sound-chip etc.  It was written
               by Merlin (the Welsh Wizard) and he has guaranteed that this
               virus is un-spreadable !!  If you want a copy of this virus to
               add to your own virus killing utilities, send a copy of your
               latest issue and I will return it with a copy of this virus !!!

Directory Waster - This is the latest virus that I have been sent - thanks go
                   to Sammy Joe of The Lost Boys !!  What it seems to do is copy
                   itself 14 times then it writes zeroes to the root directory 
                   of your disk !!!  Hence it wastes your root directory !!

 
pLink Viruses:q
-------------

Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any Link viruses.  When I do, rest
assured I will write the appropriate routines.  To protect your '.PRG' etc.
files from Link Viruses, use the 'Show Info' option on any file and set it
to be 'Read Only'.  

But, I promise that if I do manage to come across any link viruses I shall be
adding the appropriate routines to my program to detect and possibly kill
this VERY dangerous 'breed' of virus.  


                        pANTI-VIRUSES RECOGNISED:q
                        ------------------------

Anti Virus       - A bootsector utility that beeps & flashes when a disk is 
                   inserted and it has an executable bootsector.  If the disk 
                   has not got an excutable bootsector then the anti-virus will
                   copy itself to that disk.  There are two versions;
                   English and Dutch language variants.


Anti Viren Kit 2 - This bootsector just prints up the message; 

                   "Anti Viren Kit: KEIN BOOTSEKTOR VIRUS" and that's about
                   all it does.  Will NOT detect viruses at all, this is just
                   a display-message type bootsector probably written by the 
                   anti-virus program in question.  I assume that this 
                   bootsector is written to the disk after a virus has been 
                   detected by this program.


ST Guardian      - This anti-virus is a version of the anti-virus that spreads,
                   but this version does NOT spread to other disks.  This was
                   coded by my good '68000' friend, Merlin.  Thanks Merlin !!!
                   Between us, we have written an installation program that we
                   have placed into the Public Domain - look out for it !!!

GFA IMMUN.PRG    - This small program was given away on GFA BASIC v3.07 - and
                   what it does is install itself in memory and check every
                   disk that is accessed.  If an exeutable bootsector is found
                   then a message appears (in German) telling you this.
                   Upon pressing Return a non-executable bootsector is wrote
                   back to that disk.  The main problem with this program is
                   that if you copy it to your 'AUTO' folder and that particular
                   disk has an executable bootsector (that is so important that
                   you don't want to delete it) - the program attempts to repair
                   it and if you don't want it repaired it will reset itself and
                   hence load back in.  This creates an infinite loop until you
                   delete the executable bootsector (this includes the new
                   style virus-immunized bootsector by Richard Karsmakers !!).

               
LSD Anti Virus   - Written by the group LSD (Leeds Software Distribution), this
                   bootsector checks the memory for any viruses present.  If 
                   there are any present then a message is displayed on the
                   screen warning you of the presence of a virus.
                  

Medway Boys Boot - Written by the Medway Boys (in England), this bootsector
                   prints the message 'Medway Boys - Virus Free' if the program
                   detects no virus in memory otherwise another message appears
                   and the screen display is played about with !!  It is one
                   of the bootsectors that can be installed by my program.


Sagrotan         - This is a large range of virus killing utility programs that
                   are written by Henrik Alt.  Each version writes a different 
                   bootsector and I have included them all here - that is the
                   versions that I have come across.

This a shop run by a very good friend of mine - so do not send anything
anything that explodes and/or pirated software !  Demos are appreciated
though !!!  In the commercial version this address will be changed to
the 'Floppyshop ST' address (sorry Graham !!).

This is the address for any suggestions, contributions (5 quid ++ !!!!), 
bootsectors, blank disks, printer paper and anything else that you
want to send me that doesn't smell, explode or other such nasty things
as that.  I would be nice to actually receive some form of contribution from
you, esepecially if you are using this program a lot.  I have put some 11 months
of solid coding into this program, and I haven't a penny to show for it.  This
is why I have agreed to go commercial !!  If authors of good Public Domain 
software continually decide to go commercial, then Public Domain software
will be left to die a slow painful death of sampled demos and product demos
of various new games - and you wouldn't want that on your conscience, would
you ???  

         SO SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC DOMAIN/SHAREWARE AUTHORS !!

If you come across any utility that will install a virus on your disks for
you or let you design viruses - SEND IT TO ME AS QUICK AS YOUR LEGS CAN
CARRY YOU TO THE POSTBOX !!!  I need programs like this to extend my programs
knowledge of the vast number of viruses on the Atari ST.



p7. Authors' Last Note:q
----------------------

It seems that although my checking routine for bootsectors will work on my
machine during development and compiling, a number of people have sent me
copies of bootsectors that I have already detected, to find that my program
won't detect them !!  If this occurs, please let me know.  For example, if your
version of 'The Big Demo' by TEX does not get recognised, please forward a 
copy of the bootsector onto me.  This way, I can optimise my routines to make
sure they work on all machines, even when the same bootsector is checked.

If you have ANY versions of the above programs that are original (and other
less dubious types - a bootsector is a bootsector, wherever it comes from !!)
and this program does NOT detect the bootsector on it, then please use the
'Store' option in this program and send them to me with a note explaining what 
program you have and I will add the routines to differentiate between the 
different bootsectors of the same game or different games altogether.

The main culprit to the 'different game - same bootsector' is the firm
'Rob Northern' that specialises in protection systems for the Atari ST and
Amiga (he designed the ST/Amiga Format Disks).  If a game appears to have
the same bootsector as another then 'Store' the bootsector(s) and
post them to me immediately.  I have included a simple routine which checks
the bootsector for the words; "Rob Northern" or "CopylockST".  If the
Super Virus Killer comes up with a message saying that it has found a disk
with these words on it, please 'Store' it and send it to me quickly.  This way
I'll be able to keep tabs on the number of disks that Rob Northern has put his
protection onto (there are more than enough of them as well).

p8. Virus Warning to the software-purchaserq
------------------------------------------     

It has come to my attention that copies of the game - "Lombard RAC Rally" were
distributed with the Signum Virus on the disks !!! If you have this game, then
kill the virus immediately (if its on the disks) and the game will still work 
properly.

Another game that has a virus on it is 'Fast Lane' by Artronic.  The Ghost
Virus is on Disk 2 of this game.  As above, just kill the disk and the game
will still function as per normal !!

I don't know if viruses like to hide on car racing games, its just that these
two games exist with a 'FREE VIRUS' on the disks !!!!  The theory being that if
you play these games, you could be spreading a virus throughout your software
collection - unknown to yourself.

Also the 'Question Disk' of the game 'Sporting Triangles' by CDS Software, has
the 'Pirate Trap' virus on Disk 'B'.  I have since warned this firm of the 
presence of this and they have assured me that all future copies of the program
will be virus free.

Recently (on 2/7/90 to be precise), I was wandering through the disks in my
friends computer shop when I discovered the Signum virus on the following:-

Rugby League Boss by Crysus
Hostages by Inforgrames (found on the American Dreams Compilation)
Stampede Issue 2, Disk 1 (the virus was non-executable, but it was there !!)

All of these programs will fully function if you exterminate the virus from the 
infected disks.


A message to all the software companies:-
-----------------------------------------

WILL YOU PLEASE CHECK YOUR DISKS BEFORE SENDING THEM TO THE DUPLICATORS, AFTER
THEY HAVE BEEN DUPLICATED AND BEFORE YOU RELEASE THEM TO THE GENERAL CONSUMER.

IF A VIRUS IS FOUND ON YOUR DISKS, IT IS NO USE USING SOMEONE ELSE AS A 
SCAPEGOAT, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK YOUR OWN SOFTWARE BEFORE IT IS
RELEASED !!  IT WILL ONLY MAKE YOUR GOOD NAME APPEAR TO BE MUD (ESPECIALLY
IF I FIND A VIRUS ON YOUR COMMERCIAL DISKS !!) - PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL YOUR 
PRODUCTS ARE VIRUS FREE.



               Thank You:-  MUG U.K¿ - The Author (24/4/1990).
