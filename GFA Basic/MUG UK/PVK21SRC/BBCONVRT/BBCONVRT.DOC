 This program is part of the  Professional Virus Killer¿ v2.1, written by Mike
 Mee in 1992.  It is distributed in the United Kingdom by Floppyshop.

 This program is NOT Public Domain, Shareware or Licenceware.  Do not copy this
 disk  for  anybody else.   Upgrades are ONLY for registered users  and  I  can
 easily find out who sends out copies of my program!  You have been warned!

 The  main argument against copying this disk is - why bother!   For  a  measly
 œ6.95,  you  can own an original registered version!   It makes sense  to  me.

                                | Description |
                                +-------------+

 This  utility was originally written for my own use,  so that I could  convert
 various storage formats (including that from my own Super Virus Killer!)  into
 the newer Professional Virus Killer¿ v2.1 file format.

 As  and  when  I come across new storage formats,  I will  add  them  to  this
 conversion program.   As promised in v1.1 of this program, the file format
 as used by Henrik Alt (in his Sagrotan virus killer) is now convertable to
 PVK v2.1.  As I haven't got a recent version of George Woodsides' Vkiller,
 I am unable to predict that his file format will remain unchanged in the
 future, so to save me making a big cock-up, I've left his conversion routine
 out until the next update to this program.


 Simply speaking, this program has four main options.
 ----------------------------------------------------

 a) Convert from older storage file format into PVK¿ v2.1 format.

 b) Convert from Sagrotan file format into PVK¿ v2.1 format.
 
 c) Convert a RAW 512 byte file into PVK¿ v2.1 format.

 d) Delete files from a disk.

 To  select  an option,  click on the appropriate box.   This will  invert  the
 appropriate option. Now select the 'Perform Operation' button at the bottom of
 the menu.   You can return to the Desktop by selecting the appropriate  option
 from the bottom of the menu.   On doing so,  you will get a further option  of
 quitting to the Desktop or returning to the PVK main menu.


    +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |  1. Convert SVK bootsector files into PVK¿ v2.1 bootsector files.   |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This is the main option of the program.   It was included so that I could make
 the conversion process of the two separate files used by the first version  of
 Super  Virus  Killer (prior to the 25/11/89 release) into the  smaller  single
 file Professional Virus Killer format.   Please note that the 25/11/89 version
 and  subsequent  releases  already use the single file format  and  are  fully
 compatible with PVK.

 This  program was especially needed after my original Super Virus Killer  v1.0
 (the pre 25/11/89 version!) appeared on ST Format Cover Disk #8  in  February
 1990.   I have since been sent literally hundreds of different bootsectors  in
 the  old  format of 'RAW bootsector' (512 bytes) & 'Details File' (up  to  120
 bytes).   The new file takes up less disk space and your directories are not as
 cluttered with half as many files!  Plus when you have disks upon disks of
 these files, they all take up 2048 bytes on a disk regardless !! This is due
 to the format of ST disks where each file takes up a minimum of 1 cluster per
 file (which is 1024 bytes of disk space) - put these into 1 file and you
 immediately save yourself 1024 bytes !!

 Select an option from the menu and you will be prompted by a file selector for
 the name of the bootsector file to convert.  Because the early versions of SVK
 saved  out  two  separate files,  the additional .BCS  file  is  searched  for
 automatically.  If it is not found, an appropriate error message will appear.

 When the file is loaded, it is scanned to make sure that the internal checksum
 is  correct  (a horrid bug in the first versions of SVK,  which I  have  since
 sorted out!) and then the file selector will re-appear asking for the name  to
 save  the new bootsector file under.   After the new file is  saved,  assuming
 that it was saved to the same disk, the old .BCS file is deleted.  If it is on
 another disk, it is not deleted.

 On completion,  you have to option of converting another file or returning  to
 the main menu.

         +----------------------------------------------------------+
         | 2. Convert Sagrotan format to PVK bootsector file format |
         +----------------------------------------------------------+

 This function is the new conversion option to be found in this version of
 the convertor program.
  
 Henrik Alts' Sagrotan Virus Killers are popular, so long as you can understand
 German, in that it has a facility to add to a library, so that as you add to
 the library another bootsector, Sagrotan can recognise this bootsector the
 next time it comes across it.

 The files that this program can convert are the single bootsector files and
 not the large library files.  These files are 544 bytes in length and consist
 of 32 bytes of text detailing what this bootsector is, and the remaining
 512 bytes is the bootsector.  What the conversion program does is to revert
 the positions of this file so that the bootsector comes first, then the
 information and finally the PVK checksum is added.

 One final point is that Sagrotan has an in-built encryption routine that
 it uses to encrypt virus bootsectors.  If you wish to convert these bootsectors
 to PVK v2.1, the resultant file will still contain the encrypted code and
 is no use to anyone, unless you know the encryption formula - which is 
 altered on each new version of Sagrotan !!

 After each conversion, you will be given the option to return to the 
 main menu, or convert another Sagrotan file.


           +------------------------------------------------------+
           | 3. Convert RAW format to PVK bootsector file format. |
           +------------------------------------------------------+

 This  function  was  added so that those people who have  used  another  Virus
 killer, most commonly AVK by Richard Karsmakers, can convert the storage files
 saved by that program into a format recognisable by PVK.  Another program that
 saves out RAW data files is the Pompey Pirates Virus Killer by JPM.

 Basically,  the RAW format is a direct copy of the bootsector and it should be
 512 bytes in length.   If the file is too short or too long, an alert box will
 appear warning you that it cannot convert that particular file.   Another file
 selector appears for the output (PVK format) filename.

 You  will be asked for a description of this bootsector (up to  80  characters
 are allowed) which will be saved along with the stored file.   The RAW  format
 file is then saved to disk with the appropriate details attached.

 On  completion,  you have the option of converting another RAW format file  or
 returning to the menu.


                              +------------------+
                              | 4.  Delete file. |
                              +------------------+

 This  option shouldn't need any explanation but for those who are  novices,  I
 shall continue.

 A file selector appears.   Select the file that you wish to delete.   You  are
 then  asked if you're sure that you wish to delete that particular  file.   If
 you select the 'Yes' option, that file is deleted from the disk, it is no more
 .... dead .... deceased ... etc. (apologies to Monty Python!).

 As  per the other options,  you can continue on a mad spree of  deleting  more
 files or return to the menu.

 Endnote:
 --------

 I have tried my best to make this program user friendly.  If you would like to
 see  further  conversion routines added,  then write to Floppyshop  with  your
 comments and suggestions for improvements to this program.  It would also
 help if you were to name the other virus killer and send an example of its
 file format to help me with the conversion routine.

 Of course, the above option is only for REGISTERED USERS only!

 Updates:
 --------
 v1.1  August 1991.  The option to return to the PVK¿ main menu was added.
 v1.2  March 1992.  Sagrotan format now supported for conversion.
