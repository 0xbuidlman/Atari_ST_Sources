 This program is part of the Professional Virus Killer¿ v2.0b,  written by Mike
 Mee in 1991.  It is distributed in the United Kingdom by Floppyshop.

 This program is NOT Public Domain, Shareware or Licenceware.  Do not copy this
 disk  for  anybody else.   Upgrades are ONLY for registered users  and  I  can
 easily find out who sends out copies of my program!  You have been warned!

 The  main argument against copying this disk is - why bother!   For  a  measly
 œ6.95,  you  can own an original registered version!   It makes sense  to  me. 
 It's  not as if this program is sold at the outrageous prices that some  firms
 sell their Virus Killers for (especially on the PC Clones).  Would you pay  up
 to  œ300  for a Virus Killer?

                                | Description |
                                +-------------+

 Welcome  to the Professional Virus Killer's Disk Formatter v2.2.  It's a  long
 winded title but I couldn't think of anything dynamic,  interesting or curious
 to  call it,  so PVK Disk Formatter is it's name and formatting disks  is  the
 game!

 Everyone who's had an Atari ST/STE/TT for more than a week should know what  a
 disk  formatter  is!    I mean,  who actually uses the built-in  snail's  pace
 formatter on the GEM Desktop?  Without any further insults to the GEM Desktop,
 I present you with the latest incarnation of my own disk formatter!

 The  original version of this program was called the MUG UK Disk  Formatter  &
 Virus Immuniser and was released on the same compilation disk as the  original
 Super  Virus Killer v1.0.   This formatter was OK but had a few errors in  the
 programming side of things which made the FAT Tables appear to be corrupt when
 you examined the disk with a disk optimiser (DLII is the program in question!)
 although the disk was actually OK!

 Well,  I've since managed to dispose of these bugs and add a proper GEM  front
 end to the program.  I've also added many more features, including:

 a) Option to set up a 'favourite' disk format and make it the default when you
 load in the program.

 b)  Four different bootsectors can be written to the blank disk after  it  has
 been formatted.  These are:

 i)  Normal  PVK  Immunisation as used by the Professional  Virus  Killer  v2.0
 upwards. The only difference is that there is an extra text message which says
 that  the  disk  was formatted with this disk formatter  (you  can  view  this
 message  by  displaying  the bootsector from a new  formatted  disk  with  the
€ display option in Professional Virus Killer v2.0b).

 ii)  Floppyshop  Anti-Virus as used by Floppyshop on all their  Public  Domain
 disks.   This Anti-Virus does not copy itself to any other disk and its job is
 to  stay resident in memory and examine every disk that is inserted  into  the
 machine.  If the disk has an executable bootsector, the screen will flash PINK
 (in colour!) and a noise will be emitted from your ST/STE/TT!

 iii)   The  Medway  Boys  Virus  Protector  III.    This  must  be  the   most
 effective Virus detecting bootsector I've come across.   The authors certainly
 know what they're doing because this bootsector will detect any virus or reset
 proof  program  in memory and it will allow you to kill the program  which  is
 infecting memory.  The only problem is that it produces bombs on machines with
 more than 1 Meg of memory.

 iv) The Large Writing Intro.   This was originally given to me by Andy  Quayle
 at  GFA  User  and  he admits that he borrowed the  routine  from  'a  foreign
 (probably Finnish) bootsector',  so I've altered the text to say 'No Virus' on
 the screen.  This bootsector is compatible with both colour and mono screens.

 c) Fast Format option for 9 sector formatted disks.  This is especially useful
 when  you  want to load in a program faster than normal.   It is  achieved  by
 'skewing'  the  disk format with alterations to the interleave factor  on  the
 disk.  Unfortunately, this option is not available if you wish to format disks
 with 10 sectors per track.


                         +---------------------------+
                         | Running the PVK Formatter |
                         +---------------------------+

 Right,  you've read all the above,  you've got a pile of blank disks ready  to
 format and the first thing to do is run the program (i.e. double-click it).

 The  first  thing to appear is the main dialog box  introducing  the  program,
 saying who it was written by,  etc.  From here you can select to continue with
 the program or quit to the Desktop.  Should you select the Desktop option, you
 will  be presented with a further option to quit to Desktop or return  to  the
 PVK¿ main menu.

 If the above box does not appear at first,  you will get an alert box  stating
 that  the preferences file was not found.   This means that the program  could
 not find the PVKFORMT.INF file in the same directory as the program file.  All
 this  means  is  that your favourite preferences are  not  installed  and  the
 program  defaults to the standard GEM format of single  sided,  80  tracks,  9
 sectors per track and FAST format OFF.  The default bootsector that is written
 is the PVK immunisation.

 After clicking on the Continue box,  the first menu will appear ( from  hereon
 referred to as the main menu), which has three options.

 The  first option is to either set up your favourite disk format & save it  as
 the  default  or just to set the format (which remains set for any  amount  of
 disks until you switch off) and not save it.   More information on this format
€ menu in the section 'Format Options And What They Do'.

 The next option is to format your disks.   More information on this option  is
 in the next section 'Formatting Disks'.

 The last option allows you to quit to the Desktop.  Clicking on this will exit
 the program.

                             +------------------+
                             | Formatting Disks |
                             +------------------+

 If  you  click  here,  you are asked which floppy drive you  want  to  format.
 Select  the appropriate option from the dialog box by clicking on  either  the
 Drive A or Drive B buttons.

 If  you only have a single floppy disk,  then an alert box will prompt you  to
 remove  the PVK disk from drive A and replace it with the blank disk that  you
 want to format.

 You will now be presented with an alert box.   This box requires  confirmation
 that  you want to carry on with the format and that you  haven't  accidentally
 left the master copy of the latest mind blowing game in the drive instead of a
 blank!   If you select to abort this format,  you will be returned to the main
 menu.

 Whilst the disk is formatting,  another dialog box appear on the screen and if
 you watch it as the disk is formatting,  you'll notice that the track  numbers
 go BACKWARDS!   Why backwards?   Simple reasoning was used here.   If the disk
 contained  the latest game (or any other important data),  then the chance  of
 formatting  the  most  important  data stored at the  start  of  a  disk  (the
 bootsector,  FAT tables and directory) are minimised.  I cannot (and WILL NOT)
 guarantee  that  if you start formatting the wrong disk,  and  you  abort  the
 format after realising your mistake,  that the game (or whatever) is going  to
 work!  I know miracles can happen, but not when you format over the data for a
 game  they  don't!  If a program does not fill the entire  disk,  there  is  a
 greater  chance  of  recovering it.   The abort function will  be  useless  on
 commercial games disks but could be invaluable on disks full of data files  or
 small programs.

 You can abort the disk formatting in one of two ways,  either by pressing  the
 ESCAPE key or the RIGHT mouse button.   The other way of aborting a format  is
 to  remove  the disk but only people of an eccentric or insane mind  would  do
 such a thing (like the author of a disk formatter and virus killer that you've
 just bought!).  Don't try it, you could damage the drive as well as the disk.

 Once the disk has been formatted,  it is still useless until the bootsector is
 written and the directory tree  initialised.   However,  this operation  takes
 only a few seconds to perform and,  of course,  it is fully error trapped  (as
 are all my programs!).

 The  final  dialog box will appear asking you for the name of  the  disk  that
 you've just formatted.   Type in the name of the disk and press the Return key
 or use the mouse to click the 'OK' button.
€
 Finally,  an alert box will appear showing you the amount of free space on the
 disk.   You  are then returned to the main menu where you can alter  the  disk
 format, format another disk or simply quit to the Desktop.


                   +--------------------------------------+
                   |   Format Options And What They Do    |
                   +--------------------------------------+


 This  section will explain what the various options are for and why  they  are
 there!

 There  are two main options boxes,  one will set up how  many  sides,  tracks,
 sectors  and the fast format,  whilst the other is solely for selecting  which
 bootsector is to be written to the disk after the formatting is finished.

 I'll  start with the first options box,  Disk Format Required.   It is  really
 self  explanatory but I've known people to try and format a double sided  disk
 on a single sided drive (remember them, I do, a very painful experience it was
 too!).

 All  the  options  have two different choices,  more may be  added  in  future
 updates depending on suggestions received.  For now the choices are limited to
 one or the other.

 The  number of sides are (obviously) either one or two.   Giving it  any  more
 options  would be pointless (a zero sided disk or even a three sided disk -  I
 really do question people's sanity!).   If you only have a single sided drive,
 then  do not even attempt to click on 2 in the Sides option as  the  formatter
 will  attempt  to  format a non-existent side of the disk  and  will  probably
 knacker your drive (and then you'd be diskless!).

 Tracks are fairly simple too.   If your drive is capable of extended  formats,
 then  use  82  Tracks  but  if you're not so  sure  then  use  DC  Maxtrax (on
 Floppyshop's disk UTL.328) to test your drive's format capability.

 Sectors  on  the other hand will do no damage whether you set it to  9  or  10
 sectors.   In this program,  if you format a disk with 9 sectors, you can turn
 on the Fast option.   This alters the interleave of the disk so that  programs
 will load much faster.   It has the side effect of losing the maximum capacity
 but you gain speed, the choice is yours.

 In the Bootsector box you have four choices of different bootsectors which are
 written to the new disk after all the formatting is complete.   For a complete
 description of each bootsector,  see the second section of this document.  All
 the bootsectors will work on a colour TV/monitor or a mono monitor.

 The  last  two options are  self explanatory.   The Format  Menu  option  will
 return you to the main menu,  whilst the Save Parameters option will save  off
 the  current  disk format you've selected into the file  called  PVKFORMT.INF. 
 This file is what the program looks for when it first loads.   Hence,  you can
 set up your own personal format and when you run the program, you just have to
€ start formatting your disks,  knowing that they will be formatted to your  own
 specifications.

 This is the section where the owners of an ORIGINAL (i.e.  not a copy of  your
 mate's  original!)  Professional  Virus  Killer can  send  in  suggestions  to
 improve,  enhance,  beautify,  boost, add to this program.  This program NEEDS
 YOU!   I will attempt to implement any (useful) suggestions as to improvements
 to the program (and any of the others on this disk).  Just write to Floppyshop
 with your suggestions.  They will be passed onto me and I will consider adding
 them to the next upgrade.

 Updates
 -------
 v2.2   August  1991.   A bug in v2.1 caused a different bootsector  from  that
 selected  to be written.   This has been fixed.   The option to return to  the
 PVK¿ main menu was added.
