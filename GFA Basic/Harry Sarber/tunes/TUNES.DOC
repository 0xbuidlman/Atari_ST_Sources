     I wrote this program about a year and a half ago and I thought 
other people might be interested in hacking it.  It could really use
a few more things to make it more complete, but it does what I need
it to do.  Tunes runs in ST low or medium resolutions.

     Tunes gives you the ability to put notes on the screen by using
the mouse to select the note and location on the staff.  When Tunes
runs it loads in a low rez picture file.  If you are in Medium rez
it will switch to 'forced' low rez.  You are presented with an icon-
based screen to make your selections.

     Starting at the upper left corner there are two icons that look
sort of like floppy disks.  They are used to load and save Tunes.

     The next icon is a capital 'A'.  That lets you call up accessories
from within Tunes.

     The GFA button is used to write out a GFA Basic listed files with
Sound and Wave statements that you can merge into your programs.  To
this date I haven't figure out how to get the volume to work correctly
on GFA listed files.

     The next button is a few notes.  Click on that to play the Tune.

     And the last button on the upper left is an eraser for clearing
the staff.

     The upper right corner is used to display the current note and
current voice.  The three voices can be selected one at a time by
clicking on the one, two, or three icon.

     Just under the title is a slider that is used to move to different
sections of the staff.  You can use the arrows on either side to move
one note at a time in the direction that the arrow points.

     To the left of the title is the speed bar.  This adjusts the tempo
of the Tune.

     To the right of the title is the volume bar.  Since GFA listed 
files don't come out right the way I had them set up with the volume
adjustment the volume control has been 'disabled' when you write a
GFA listed file. (I don't even think it's in the source code anymore)

     In the center of the screen is the staff.  You place notes on the
staff by clicking the left button when the note is in the proper
location.  To clear a note just click again in the same note location
and the note will disappear.

     And finally, at the bottom of the screen is where you make your
note and rest selections.  You can also make the note sharp, flat, or
dotted.

     That's about it.  Like I said earlier, it could use a lot more,
but I don't have the time to put into it.  Maybe someone else would
like to add some things to it or use it for Tunes in their own
programs.  The source code has very few comments in it.  Some places
are real bowls of spaghetti.  I probably shouldn't have broken it
down into so many subroutines, etc., etc., etc.  :)

     Just so I don't forget.  This source code is being sent out as
Freeware.  If you make some great mods to it would you please send me
a copy?
