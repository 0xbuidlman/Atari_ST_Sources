     Programmers Pak is a utility I wrote a while back that helps 
when I'm programming.  It runs in all three ST resolutions and can 
be setup as a program or as an accessory.

     Programmers Pak has six utilities.  They are:

          1) Patterns
          2) Text sizes and styles
          3) Line sizes and styles
          4) Marker styles
          5) Scan codes
          6) ASCII codes

     It's not a lot, but it helps to have it around instead of 
having to find it in a manual.  And best of all, GFA Basic source 
code is included!

     To get Programmers Pak up and running copy PROGPK10.PRG and 
PROGPK10.RSC (color) or PROGPKHI.RSC (mono) into the same 
directory.  Run PROGPK10.PRG.

     To install Programmers Pak as an accessory simply rename 
PROGPK10.PRG to PROGPK10.ACC and copy it into your root directory 
of your startup drive.  Also copy PROGPK10.RSC (color) or 
PROGPKHI.RSC (mono) into the same directory as PROGPK10.ACC.
Reboot your system to install the accessory.

     Programmers Pak is being distributed as Freeware.  Any damage 
to your system from the use of this program is not my 
responsibility.
