'       GFA Basic Example for determining the address of procedures and
'       functions at runtime. This will only work after it's been compiled
'       and linked with the file get_addr.o

PRINT "This is a test"          ! Do something to show thr program is running
PRINT "Calling procedure at address:";@x_addr
extremely_long_name             ! Call the procedure. The procedure will
'                                 determine its own address
'
'
FUNCTION x_addr                 ! Here the linker will insert the C function
  $X get_addr
  PRINT "Not implemented in Interpreter..."     ! Nothing to do here...
  RETURN 0                      ! Return a dummy value
  ' It does not matter what you call this function in GFA, just the $X is important
ENDFUNC

'
PROCEDURE extremely_long_name           ! This is the procedure you want to get
  PRINT "This is the procedure extremely_long_name"     ! the address of.
  a%=@x_addr                            ! Get the address
  PRINT "Its address is: ";a%;"  or $";HEX$(a%)         ! And print it
  PRINT "That's all..."                 ! Sign off
RETURN
'
'       You of course can determine the value of extremely_long_name
'       anywhere in the program. x_addr will *always* return the address
'       of the procedure extremely_long_name
