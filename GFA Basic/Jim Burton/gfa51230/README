SHOW512.GFA is a GFA BASIC 3.0 version of Charles Medley's GFA512.LST,
a GFA BASIC 2.0 program which allows the showing of Spectrum 512
pictures.  GFA512.LST and GFA512.PRG are in the October issue
of STatus disk magazine, which has been released for free distribution.
STatus is an excellent magazine, and I urge you to find, download,
and read the October issue.  It is well worth your support.

In SHOW512.GFA I have used the INLINE command to hold the C programs 
from TRIO which allow the showing and decompression of SPECTRUM pics.
Please read GFABASIC.ASC, the article which appeared in STatus,
and GFA512.LST, the original GFA BASIC 2.0 source.

Thanks, Charles Manley! I was wondering how to show .SPC pics!
And congratulations on a fine magazine.
