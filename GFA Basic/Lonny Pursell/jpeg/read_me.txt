This archive contains some crude GFA-Basic code to load
jpeg images.  It does not load all jpeg variants, but it
loads the most common ones.

I don't claim to have figured this out on my own, nor do
I completely understand the jpeg format.  This program is
the result of porting a jpeg viewer that was originally
coded in Quick Basic.  The only thing I claim to have done
was to figure out how to port QuickBasic to GFA-Basic.
Some of the QuickBasic commands had to be redone a totally
different way.

Note: It runs very slow, even when compiled.

The original QuickBasic listing is included so that credit
is given where it's due.

Use completely at your own risk!  :)
