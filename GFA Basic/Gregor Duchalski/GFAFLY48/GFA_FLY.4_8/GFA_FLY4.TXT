Flying Dialogs for GFA, v4.8. Enhanced GEM [German docs]

These routines are supported by Gregor Duchalski, the Two-in-One author, 
and add all the nice features missing in GFA Basic. Pop-up menus, Circle 
buttons, modal window dialogs, colour icons flying alert boxes, 3D support, 
Interface support, compatible with Fly and MyDials. Only generates an extra 
2Kb Inline code!

Because of the Two-in-One link this is also now CIX supported software by 
me. Registration is 13ukp and includes access to many other desirable 
registered user only routines. Gregor has been supporting these for ages, I 
only got round to uploading them because a Two-in-One user registered and 
wanted to register these as well! Maybe Andre and Kev should take a look! 
(I'd dearly love an enhanced GEM Cixcomm/read combination). Naturally I'll 
help with translations where necessary if it helps bring this about :-|
