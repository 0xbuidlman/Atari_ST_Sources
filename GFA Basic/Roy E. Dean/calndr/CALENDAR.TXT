      Written and compiled with GFA BASIC 35e.

      This DA will appear on the desktop as on open window with a calendar
showing inside the open window.  The side arrows will either increment the
calendar month or decrement the months.  Up arrow is decrement months. 
Down arrow will increment months.  Year end or year beginning will
increment or decrement to the next succeding or preceding year.  The left
and right arrows will cause the years to increment of decrement.  Left
arrow is decrement years.  Right arrow is increment years.  The vertical
slider bar will return you the the current month and year.  The window
close box will cause an alert box to QUIT or NO.  The space bar will do an
alert stating title of DA --  Calendar ½ Choices  -- and the author--.  The
ESC key or 'Q' key will also cause the quit alert box to appear.

      Now how do I code this so that it will also run as a .PRG file and an
ACC by changing the name.
