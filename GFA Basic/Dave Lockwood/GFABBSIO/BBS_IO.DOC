To   : BBS DOORS PROGRAMMERS
From : DAVE LOCKWOOD at THE CONTROL ROOM ST! 14.4K HST
Subj : PD BBS I/O Library



     There have been so many  people asking  for I/O routines for  On-Line
programs that I decided to  release my  old I/O  library in GFA.  It's not
elegant, but it is fast, and give you at least line oriented I/O easily.
 
Here's a list of Global variables:
 
Lf!       ! True if User needs linefeed (set by init routine)
Loc!      ! True if Local (run from console...set by init routine)
Snoop!    ! True if Sysop can snoop (must be set by program)
Username$ ! User's Handle (set by init routine...may be same as Realname)
Realname$ ! User's Real name (set by init routine...may equal Username)
Password$ ! If Init_other is used, the user must supply a password.
 
The following may be set by the Init routine for a given BBS:
 
Level%    ! Init_forem & Init_star - Access level of user (varies by BBS)
Minleft%  ! Init_forem             - (number of minutes left on BBS)
Points%   ! Init_star              - (Number of User points)
Col%      ! Init_star              - Columns (ST-80 8bit-40 etc.)
 
(There are others depending on the Init routine being used)
 
Here's a list of routines:
 
Procedure Errhand                   ! brain damaged error handler
Procedure Fixcstring(Qx$,Sptr%)     ! truncates nulls from C strings
Procedure Init_star                 ! Init glabal vars from USER.TMP
Procedure Init_forem                ! Init global vars from FOREM.DAT
Procedure Init_st                   ! Init global vars from environment
Procedure Init_other                ! Init global vars from user
Procedure Getenv(Nam$,Ptr%)         ! fetch value from environment
Procedure Toul(S$,Sptr%)            ! "ANY STRING" ---> "Any String"
Procedure Inchar(Time%,Echo!,Cptr%) ! Get a char from modem/console
Procedure Clrs                      ! Clear screen (modem & console)
Procedure Outchar(Ch%)              ! Send char to modem/console
Procedure Getline(Sptr%)            ! get text line from modem/console
Procedure Outline(L$)               ! send line to modem/console
Procedure Outstring(L$)             ! send string (no EOL) modem/console
Procedure Getdcd                    ! check carrier  result in Dcd!
Procedure Getparams(Ptr%)           ! get command line
 
Here's the deal:
 
I'm placing these in the public domain.  Anyone can use 'em for anything
(legal and moral) that they want to.  All I ask is that if you intend to
make money from a program that uses these routines, that you include the
words: "Portions written by Dave Lockwood".  This may be asking alot but
I've been developing this code since my 8-bit daze and I think I deserve
the credit.  The code itself will be posted in several parts, 1 per day.
If you miss any of the pieces,  I will Fnet the whole thing to those few
after all parts have gone out.  I hope you find them useful.
