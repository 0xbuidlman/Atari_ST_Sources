Mr. Eliza - The Talking Psychiatrist

Eliza is (c) Creative Computing

This program is an updated version of the classic Eliza psuedo-psychiatrist
program that was popular back in the beginning of time (computer-wise).
It uses the STSPEECH.TOS program to simulate speech.  To use it, simply
put MRELIZA.BAS, GFABASR2.PRG, and STSPEECH.TOS in the same folder and
run GFABASR2.PRG.  Select MRELIZA.BAS with the file selector, turn up the
volume on your monitor and enjoy!  When you are finished with your session
with Mr. Eliza, just type 'shut up' and he'll get the message.

Note :  Since it helps to have the monitor volume way up, many people
        prefer to turn off the keyclick before running Mr. Eliza.
