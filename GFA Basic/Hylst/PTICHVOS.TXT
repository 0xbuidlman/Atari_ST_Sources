Le jeu de petits chevaux (c)1997
fastly coded in GFA by Hylst.
It can be runned under ST/FALCON. 
Many bugs may appear but rarely
i think. Anyway, everybody can ask
me 4 the code source.
However,  the computer player role
has not been finished so that U can
only play between humans...
Limited interest... I know... 
I wanted 2 add SFX and dempo effects
with pics 4 the winner but...who
cares... so i have definitly decided
to spread this oldie...

ATARI rules 4 ever !!
