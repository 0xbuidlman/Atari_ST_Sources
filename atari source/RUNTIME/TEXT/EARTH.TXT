üüüWhen your're millions of years old,
you don't just celebrate for a day.
That's why Atari is holding a year-long
party.
The Millennium Celebration.
üüüAlong with the sights, entertainment
and sumptuous dining you'll always
find, there are now music festivals,
street fairs, sporting events, lavish
fireworks, and the world's largest
birthday cake.
üüüA 3 night Californian stay in a first
class hotel, including full breakfasts
and an evening at the renowned Abbey
theater, is only ù$138 per personø.* Or
you can take in the entire planet with a
week's vacation, including a rental car
and lodging, for just ù$189 per personø.
üüüYou'll find getting to Earth on
TransWorld Atari to be exceptionally
easy. Tearing yourself away will be a
bit harder.
