üüThey're some of the most
respected scientific minds in the
country.
üüThey're also mad.
üüYou would be too if you had to
design and conduct critical research
in Atari's Life Sciences building.
üüThere are cracks in the ceilings
and cracks in the walls.
üüAnd leaks in all the cracks.
üüBecause of the rotten plumbing.
üüWhich may be what's causing
those terrible odors.
üüThe ones that won't go away, on
account of all the ventilation
problems.
üüAnd it won't be long before we'll
have to put laboratories in the
lavatories. (We've just about
filled up the halls.)
üüDespite these and other
hardships, our Biosciences
departments continue to
achieve world acclaim for
breakthrough research in
cancer prevention, brain
development, and many other
areas.
üüBut the fact remains, Nobel
Prize winners and Gug
genheim Fellows don't grow
on trees. In order to hang on
to those we have, and continue
to attract top faculty, we need
more than a few new beakers
and Bunsen burners.
üüWe need your support.
üüBecause largely through
private contributions, we hope
to begin building a Biological
Sciences facility 
befitting a
world class corporation.
üüSo please call the number
below.
üüAnd help us put a stop to this
madness.
