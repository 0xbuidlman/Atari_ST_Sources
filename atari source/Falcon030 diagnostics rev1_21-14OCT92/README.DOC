The Falcon030 Rev. 1.20 source files are contained on 3 disks. Copy all 
3 disks to one directory on a hard disk. These disks include "bat" 
files that will automatically generate a binary file when run. 

     To make a file for loading into a 512k cartridge (2 Eproms):

          1.) Run "1command.prg" from the desk top. 
          2.) Type "make" from the command line followed by a c/r.
          3.) Type "exit" followed by a c/r to return to the desk top.

     This will create a binary file called "sp.out". This file can 
     then be loaded into two 512k EPROMs Via an EPROM burner.

          NOTE: The Real Time Clock should be set since the "make"
                program checks it for the current time/date.
