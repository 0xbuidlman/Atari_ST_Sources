
01/28/93 cjg - This version of XCONTROL is the release version
 	       for the FALCON and MULTI-TOS.
	     
	     - NOTE: After building the Control Panel, run PRGFLAGS
	             and set the PROTECTION to SUPERVISOR.
		     This is so that there is no conflict when
		     the exchange mouse button vector occurs.
