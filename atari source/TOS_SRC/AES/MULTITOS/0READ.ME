Various notes and warnings about the AES:

(1) Bconin(2) and Bconstat(2) can have different meanings in different
processes under MiNT. Specifically, the multitasking AES arranges for
Bconin(2) to effectively do an evnt_keybd(), so that old programs that
mix BIOS and AES calls will still work correctly. (It does this by
creating a MiNT device called AES_BIOS, and redirecting console I/O to
this device when creating a subprocess in shel_fork().)
