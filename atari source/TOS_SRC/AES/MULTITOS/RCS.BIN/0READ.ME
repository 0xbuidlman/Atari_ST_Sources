This is the directory for keeping backup copies of binary files which
we can't check into rcs. Primarily, this is for the .rcs and .dfn files
of the various country resources.

The subdirectories (e.g. 100, 101, etc.) hold the binaries for the various
released versions of MultiTOS (e.g. 1.00, 1.01, etc.). Files that never
change (e.g. aesindex, osbind.o) are placed in this directory.
