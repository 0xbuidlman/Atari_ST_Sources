         Journal listing for DeskSet II

11/01/87 - God Created DeskSet II

09/27/88 - We've decided to start a journal

	 (1) FILE.C      load_doc() - Fixed a problem of loading a document
				      that didn't begin on page 1. Before,
				      display would always start on page
				      1 even if the first page is page X...

	 (2) REDRAW.C    free_rbuffs() - Fixes restoring curpage. Without
					 curpage, we would end up always on
					 the last page.

	 (3) METAMAKE.C  meta_make() - Slight modifications to prevent
				       certain vdi metafile commands from
				       executing...	

         (4) RESOURCE.C  do_go_page()- Set page in dialog box with the current
				       page, before displaying dialog box.

					 
09/28/88 - 01/02/89 - Scuba Diving - Deep Dive - 85ft
				   - Night Dive, Navigation, and 
				   - light Search and Recovery
				   Notes: Vertigo and sea sickness
					  are no fun...
		    - Skiing       - Perfect conditions at 
				     Sierra Ski Ranch
				   - Nice Blizzard at Kirkwood and 
				     Heavenly Valley
				   - Reaffirm my hatred of moguls (sp?)

		    - Bug Fixes and New Features
		      So Numerous that I forgot to mention them.
		    - Sent and Received Code To and From G.O. Graphics
		    - Air Warrior is FUN! FUN! FUN!
		      Squadron finally won a Campaign!!! (Rah Rah RAh)
		    - F16 Falcon received - Pretty Cool STuff
		    - Received Master Level characters for Dungeon Master
			
Addendum: 12/25/88  - Merry Christmas

	  01/01/89  - Happy New Year

01/03/89 - Received menu.c from C.Suko
	 - Modified Resource.c and Setup.c
	   Fixes Grouping Regions and modifications of attributes
	 - Sent G.O. Graphics a new Memory Driver and SLM804 Driver


01/04/89 - Files: DeskSet2.*
		  Handlers.c
		  Resource.c
	   Modifications: 1) Resources modified to allow Scan Offset 
			     Dialog Box to take XXX formats instead of
			     9999 format
	 	          2) Fixed button handling when a primitive is
			     selected, a button press occurs outside
			     of any region, and the region is outlined
			     in primitive diamonds.
			     Action taken was to clear region pointers
			     and menu items so that no region is selected.
			  3) Fixed dialog boxes that use Parmcheck().
			     If an input error occurs, we stay in the
			     dialog box.
	 
		  Received files from Craig.
			  Handlers.c,Resource.c,Menu.c,Errors.c,Redraw.c

		  Modified File.c and Handlers.c
		  Action: Default Preview Window Title to "Preview Window"
				  When load or save a document, the file name
				  is not in the preview window title area.
				  If  NEW occurs, then revert back to
				  "Preview Window".

			  Fixes Default Paths if there is no '\'.
			  and adds it in if there is none. No action taken
			  if a slash already exists.


	   Evening - AirWarrior Report
		     JV44 Squadron (I'm one of them) repulsed an
		     attack on the A's Radar by the Commie B's.
		     Casualties were light with the entire attacking
		     B force destroyed.  Yours truly shot down 2 bogies.

01/05/89 - Modified Redraw.c and Draw.c

	 - Action Taken: Fixes bug where a redraw_area() call will
			 redraw templates and page numbers correctly.
			 Before, they just wouldn't be redrawn.

01/06/89 - Modified Redraw.c

	 - Had problems with redraw.c and templates with more than
	   one region. Hey, its' all taken care of now, ok?
	   Resolution was to check 'display_templates()' and
           the parenthesis blocks.


	 - Received ifout.c and handlers.c from Craig


01/09/89 - Received asm.c and handlers.c from Craig
	   Implements copy multiple regions at a time


	 - Kicked up the latest sources to the VAX

01/09/89 - Modified handlers.c,menu.c file.c and deskset2.rsc

	 - Changed all references in dialog boxes, windows and
	   menu items from templates to base page.

	 - When showing or hiding the ruler, we make sure
	   that it is topped first. Otherwise, we would 
	   erroneously write over an open desk accessory.
	   solution: do a wind_set(handle,WF_TOP,dummy...) call.
	   when ruler flag is toggled in menu_handler().
	 
	 - Received asm.c and stuffptrs.s from Craig. Speeds up
	   the hj routines.


01/10/89 - modified file.c handlers.c windows.c redraw.c
	 - Solution: - Adjusted preview window name modifications
	  	     - Also, when switching to base page mode, would
		       lose file name at the preview window name.


	 - Handlers.c - button_end()
		      - removed vs_clip(handle,0,pxy) which cleared
			the clip rectangle.

	 - Handlers.c - menu_handler()
		      - When a NEW is performed, we set text attributes
			to their defaults.
		
	 - Handlers.c - Do_move_region() and do_move_prim()
		      - Check if a horizontal or vertical line and
		        outline them instead of shrinking a box arnd the
			chosen region.
			Before, the box would xor itself away.

	 - Redraw.c   - redraw_area()
		      - Moved the DO_GRIDS() call after where the 
			clip rectangle is set.

         - Menu.c     - Genesis_region()
		      - When creating a text region, don't reset attributes.
			Just use whatever the font dialog box is currently 
			set at.

	 - Handlers.c - rect_intersect()
		      - Instead of > thans, switch to >=

	 
01/11/89 - Gone Skiing - Kirkwood.
	 - Summary     Clear-Cold-Windy-Empty
		       Half the lifts were closed due to high winds,
		       but there was almost nobody else there.
		       Ergo, we did TONS of runs down intermediate runs.
		       Unfortunately, Lift 4 was closed. Great ravine or gully
		       between lifts 2 and 3. A Must Ski!

01/12/89 - Modified Handlers.c
	 - Routine: Do_Nada()
	            
		    graf_rubbox(mx,my,&blah,&blah);
		    scrntomu(blah,blah,&newblah,&newblah,0);

		    change to:

		    scrntomu(blah,blah,&newblah,&newblah,1);

		    We are not converting vertices in this case.
		    Therefore, the flag must be a 1 because we don't want
		    to adjust for window offsets.

	 - Talked to Henry Nguyen. Morning.
	 - Talked to Henry Nguyen. Afternoon
	 - Printed out a listing.
	


01/13/89 - Happy Friday the 13th - Jason is a *(&^

	 - Modified Handlers.c
	   do_move_multi() - Modified so that vertical and
			     horizontal lines have an outline
			     instead of being xor'ed out.

	 - Gave Craig sources.

	 - Received files from G.O. Graphics
	   cmd.c keycurs.c tagmenu.c twcmd.c twdraw.c


01/16/89 - Received Handlers.c and Draw.c from CS
	   Adds Delete Multiple Regions and also
	   modified handjreg() in draw.c.

01/17/89 - Modified - Convert.c
		      handlers.c
		      resource.c
		      redraw.c
		      cnvrt.h
		      ifout.c
	 - Excuses: - It has been discovered that
		      72pts != 1 inch.
		    - Instead, its 72.xxxx, ergo
		      the number of machine units in an
		      inch for vertical and horizontal
		      should not be 1152 and 1296.
		      butinstead 1156 and 1301.
		    - Files that required mu conversions
		      such as conversion routines, grids, and
		      rulers had to be modified.  However,
		      not all might have been found.
		    - Several G.O. Graphic files needed to
		      also be modified.

	- Modified Resource.c, hj.c and deskset2.*
	- Line space is now treated only as point size.


01/23/89 - Received DBASE.C from CS
	 - Fixes the loading of a file from the clipboard.

	 - Modified Redraw.c and Resource.c
	 - Effects the redraw of line widths

	 - Received DRAW.C from CS

	 - Restored IFOUT.C and CNVRT.H to their former selves.
