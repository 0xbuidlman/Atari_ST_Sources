OFFICIAL NOTICE - POST IMMEDIATELY
DANGEROUS VIRUS
First, a little history.ü The X window system
escaped from Project Athena at MIT where
it was being held in isolation.ü When
notified, MIT stated publicly that ``MIT
assumes no responsibility....''.ü This is a
very disturbing statement.ü It then infiltrated
Digital Equipment Corporation, where it has
since corrupted the technical judgement of
this organization.

After sabotaging Digital Equipment
Corporation, a sinister X consortium was
created to find a way to use X as part of
a plan to dominate and control interactive
window systems.ü X windows is sometimes
distributed by this secret consortium free of
charge to unsuspecting victims.ü The
destructive cost of X can not even be
guessed.

X is truly obese - whether it's mutilating
your hard disk or actively infesting your
system, you can be sure its up to no good.
Innocent users need to be protected from
this dangerous virus.ü Even as you read this,
the X source distribution and the executable
environment created is being maintained on
hundreds of computers -maybe even your
own.

Digital Equipment Corporation is already
shipping machines that carry this dreaded
infestation.ü It must be destroyed.

This is what happens when software with
good intentions goes bad.ü It victimizes
innocent users by distorting their perception
of what is and what is not good software.ü
This malignant window system must be
destroyed.

Ultimately DEC and MIT must be held
accountable for this heinous ùsoftware
crimeø, brought to justice, and made to pay
for a ùsoftware cleanupø.ü Until DEC and
MIT answer to these charges, they both
should be assumed to be protecting
dangerous software criminals.

ùDon't be fooled!!ü Just say no to X.ø

in YOUR way.ü X windows.ü Live the nightmare.ü X windows.ü More than enough rope.
