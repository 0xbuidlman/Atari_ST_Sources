Welcome to the exciting
world of desktop publishing.
Now you can produce an en
tire document from start to
finish, right at your keyboard.
Design your pages, write
your text, add art, and print.
You never have to trust your
work to others. You have
complete control over your
publications!

Today you can publish out of
your own home. Back in the old days you would 
have had to fill your den with typesetting equipment, your garage with a 
printing press, and your bathroom with expensive camera equipment. And now? 
Now you can put your MEGA, a hard drive, a monitor, and a laser printer on 
the desk in your den or living room. What can be more practical?
