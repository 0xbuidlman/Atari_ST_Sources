The Prism Paint File Viewer is a public domain program that displays
both the compressed and uncompressed ".PNT" picture files saved by
Lexicor Software's Prism Paint ST/TT drawing program.

To use the viewer, double click on the file PNTVIEW.PRG.  After the
program has loaded, you will see the viewer's main dialog box.  The
following options are available.


The View Option:
================

When the "View" button is clicked, a file selector will be displayed
so that you can choose the file, or files, you wish to view.  To look
at a single PNT file, locate its name in the file selector list or type
its name into the selector's text input line.  Then click the OK button
or press the return key.

If you want to look at several files in a 'slide-show' like fashion,
enter a filename in the file selector that contains the '*' or '?'
wildcards.  For example; typing "*.PNT" would display all the PNT
files in the directory indicated by the pathname of the file selector.
A complete explanation of wildcards is beyond the intent of this
document, but you should be able to find all the information you
need in the user's manual that came with your computer.

After a picture has been displayed, the viewer will wait either until
you press a key, or for a prespecified time delay to occur (About 5
seconds).  This is controlled by the "Wait for Keypress" and "Wait for
Timeout" options in the main dialog.

If you entered a file specification that contained wildcards, and
selected the "Wait for Keypress" option, the viewer will stop after
each picture is displayed.  It will not display the next picture until
you press a key.  If you want to return to the main dialog before all
the PNT files have been displayed, press the UNDO key.

If you entered a file specification that contained wildcards, and
selected the "Wait for Timeout" option, the viewer will wait a short
amount of time before showing the next picture.  If you want to stop
the viewer from advancing, and look at the current picture, press the
SPACE BAR.  The program will now wait for you to press another key
before it continues.  To return to the main dialog immediately, press
the UNDO key.


The Info Option:
================

Because Prism Paint uses the PNT file extension for its pictures,
regardless of the resolution, it is possible to attempt to view a PNT
file that was created in a different resolution from the one you are
currently in.  When this happens, the VIEW option will simply ignore
the picture.  If you would like to know more about a PNT picture that
was ignored by the viewer, or about any PNT picture in general, click
on the INFO option in the main dialog.  Next, select the name of the
PNT file you want to know more about from the file selector and click
on OK.  The program will then display information about the PNT file
in a dialog box.  This information includes; the name of the file, the
number of bytes the file takes up on disk, the width and height of
the picture, and whether or not the PNT file is compressed.  To return
to the main dialog from the INFO dialog, click on the OK button.

The QUIT Option:
================

To quit the program and return to the desktop, select the Quit button
in the main dialog box.
