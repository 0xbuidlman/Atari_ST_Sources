Changes and/or additions to be done in HDX:
===========================================
--> Do not do mode_select() during format for Syquest.  The 
    Syquest drive has its own default values saved on the medium.
    [DONE.  A new id is added to wincap to tell program not to do
     mode_select() when appropiate.]

--> The Syquest's mode_sense() is different from the Adaptec's.  The
    sense data returned has to be interpreted differently.
    [DONE.]

--> Set a reasonable number of vendor bad sectors allowed during physical 
    markbad after format.  If number of bad sectors found exceeds that
    number, give a warning and see if user wants to continue or forget
    about the disk.

--> In relation to GEMDOS:
	- Allow maximum size of a partition up to (32Mb - 1 sector). 
	  Number of bytes per sector stays at 512.
	  [DONE.]

	- Make size of a cluster flexible.  2**n sectors/cluster.
	  [DONE.  Partitions < 16Mb in size have 2 sectors per
	   cluster; partitions >= 16Mb and <= (32Mb - 1 sector)
	   have 4 sectors per cluster.]

--> In relation to IBM-ST compatibility:
	- Give option in format for IBM or ST format.
  		- For IBM format, set up the FATs, root and boot sectors 
		  the same way as MS-DOS is.
    		  Driver will return BPB to Gemdos with the bit set 
		  correctly for 12-bit or 16-bit FATs.
		- For ST format, set them up the same way as we are now.
	- Make sectors per cluster dependent on size of a partition 
	  (just like IBMs).
	- To signify a boot sector is executable, write 0x55aa as last
	  2 bytes.
	- Make partitions on cylinder boundary.
	- Have more than 4 partitions.  Use extended partition scheme
	  in DOS 3.3.  This requires major change in user-interface.



Changes and/or additions to be done in AHDI:
============================================
--> Have to take care of both IBM and ST types of root and boot sectors.
    (Boot sectors are actually the same for IBM and ST.)

--> Use software lock?
    [No.]

--> New firmware from Syquest polls to see if user want to remove the 
    media.
    [Don't have to use it if we decide that user can have the medium
     if he pops it.]

--> Can drive be write-protected by software?
    [No.]

--> Need to use 10-byte commands (i.e. 10 bytes for addresses) in 
    drivers, so that we can address to bigger hard disks.

--> Have to decide how many drive letters to be dedicated to Syquest.
    (The idea to fix a Syquest media to have only 2 partitions is
     kind of restrictive.  What if the media's size grow later?)

--> Have to deal with extended partitions in both IBM and ST format.

--> Have to build BPB at demand, not just at initialization time.
    [One suggestion is to have a bit mask for media change.  That is,
     we have one bit representing each drive letter.  If a medium has
     been changed, the bit corresponding to that drive is set.  When
     a drive is accessed, the driver will check that bit, if it is
     is set, build the BPB of that drive, and zap the bit.  At boot
     time, all bits will be set.  This has the advantage that if a
     drive is never accessed, its BPB doesn't need to be built.]

--> The matter about media change.  Should handle it just like the floppy.
    Have to decide on a way to test if medium has been changed (one 
    suggestion is to checksum the 2nd FATs of all partitions on the 
    medium).

--> May want to have a generic routine to send command and to do dma.
    Should consider different time outs for different functions 
    (probably an extra parameter to the generic routine.  For example,
     format takes a long time, mode_sense could take a long time if 
     need to seek to end of disk but not as long as format).



Changes and/or additions to be done in FHDX:
============================================
--> Syquest cartridges came formatted, should not format again at factory.
    (make up new a flag in wincap to tell program not to format and have
     the program test for it.)
