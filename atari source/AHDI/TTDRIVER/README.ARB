	This AHDI 4.04a is a PRELIMINARY version that supports SCSI
Arbitration.  Disconnect and Reconnect are NOT supported yet.  If
Arbitration is lost, timed-out (-1) will be returned (for now.)  This 
version works exactly the same as version 4.03, except that the initiator
will go into the Arbitration phase before it goes into the Selection 
phase.

	Please let me know how this works.
