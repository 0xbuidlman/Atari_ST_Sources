==========================

This test allows you to have Sound DMA, Sparrow SCSI DMA, BLiTTER 
transfers, and IDE spin-up spin-down all going at the same time.

Sound DMA
---------
0x2000 bytes of data are recorded from the screen base address 
(stored at $ffff8201, $ffff8203, $ffff820d), and played back at a 
location 0x2000 bytes passed the screen base address.

There are 2 modes of record and play back.  One is 2-channel loop 
back through RASCAL.  The other is 10-channel loop back through 
the loop back connector.


Sparrow SCSI DMA 
----------------
A write-read-verify test is performed on the last 254 sectors of 
the SCSI drive (i.e. the test WILL trash the last 254 sectors of 
the drive.)


BLiTTER transfers
-----------------
256 words of data are moved from one buffer to another.  Both 
buffers are allocated at run time.  The source buffer contains 
the repeating test pattern of 0x00 through 0xff.  After the transfer, 
the contents of the buffers are compared to ensure the transfer was 
successful.

If Sparrow SCSI DMA is enabled, the BLiTTER transfer will occur after
the SCSI DMA has started and before the SCSI interrupt is polled.


IDE spin-up spin-down
---------------------
When the program starts, it configures the IDE drive to spin down 
every 60 seconds if there is no IDE activity.  Then, every 62 seconds, 
the program will spin the drive back up.  (i.e. If there is no IDE 
activity for 60 sec., the drive will spin itself down, then 2 seconds 
later, the program will send a command to spin it back up.

If Sparrow SCSI DMA is enabled, the IDE spin-up will occur after the 
SCSI DMA has started and before the SCSI interrupt is polled.



Please note that:
-----------------
1) Sparrow must be running in 16MHz.
2) At start up, every test is enabled.  Each one of them can be
   disabled individually.
3) If an error occurred, the test that failed will be disabled,
   it can be re-enabled by hitting the key that activates it.
