Version 6.05c
=============

May-25-93	jye: Added some codes to unlock the floptical drive InSite I325VM

			by send a 'mdsense' commend with page code 0x2e, and allocation

			lenth 42. This kind of drive is very slow in spin up when power

			on, so give at lease 15 seconds after turn on this kind of drive
			
			before turning on the computer, or this kind of drive won't be 
			
			able to read from it.


Version 6.05b
=============

May-19-93	jye: Add a check point that can tell the removable drive, for

			example, SyQuest SQ55, and set the short time out for this kind

			of drive, this way can reduce the boot up waiting time when the

			removable drive with no cartridge there, but at the same time it

			still work for those drives with the long reset time. Modified

			in file 'install.s'.


May-18-93 	jye: Fixed a bug that made Falcon was hang on there when open the

			directories after the boot up, which using AHDI 6.05 or 6.05a with

			CACHE080.PRG to do the boot up. Craig Suko and Eric Smith rearranged

			the declare variable 'partsize' down from the 'cookie' variable, the
			
			'partsize' variable they defined for adding some memory check for 

			the AHDI 6.05. Because the CACHE080.PRG only knows that address to

			get the cookie variable, so when 'partsize' defined before 'cookie',

			this way will push down the 'cookie' address, then CACHE080.PRG will

			got the wrong address, therefore, all kind strange things will 

			happen.


Version 6.05a
=============

May-11-93	jye: Fix a bug that made the AHDI did not pass the boot process

			when the SyQuest SQ55 had no cartridge inside. Modified in file 

			'install.s'.


Version 6.05
=============

Apr-28-93 	jye: Released a new version of AHDI 6.05.

Apr-26-93	jye: Smith Eric added some codes to the Driver.s and ahdi.h to 
			
			make some boundary check.



Version 6.04
=============

Apr-9-93 	jye: Release a new version of AHDI 6.04.



Version 6.03a
=============

Mar-15-93 	jye: Fixed a bug since I took over the AHDI.PRG 6.03, so I gave a

			version number for the new AHDI.PRG, it is AHDI.PRG 6.03a.

	The AHDI6.03 has a problem when it scans the drives in the train, it can't 
	
	recognize those drive with a slow reset to the ready state inside the drive, 
	for example, IBM OEM 0663E15, SyQuest 88MB drives. After the AHDI6.03 makes 
	
	the 'inquiry()' call to request the informations of this drive, AHDI right a
	
	way to read the Root sector within 1 second, but IBM OEM drive is still not 
	
	read to be read after the 'inquiry()' call, it takes about 5 second to reset
	
	and get the drive ready to be read, so the 'hread()' get the non zero return 
	code which is the drive is still busy code, but the AHDI6.03 doesn't check

	this case, so AHDI treat non zero return will mean no drive in that slot, so

	the AHDI6.03 can't recognize this kind of drive. Now I add some codes in the

	'install.s' to check to see if the drive is busy, if so just loop to try to

	read it again, or time out. So the AHDI6.03a fixed this bug too.



Mar-19-93	jye: For the new AHDI.PRG 6.03a, fixed one big problem.

	Found a bug, it was a software problem in AHDI.PRG -- The timing problem 

	between the DMA controller and the drive when handshaking after the Command
	
	or Status or Data transfer. When this kind of DMA method transfer occur,
	
	first the controller send 6 bytes of the command blocks, then do some hand-

	shaking, one of the handshaking is get the status byte, but when reading

	the status byte, have to check and wait for the REQ to come, then read the

	status byte, and the rest DMA transfer can go on to finish. For the AHDI6.03

	and HDX5.01, they didn't check and waiting for the REQ to come, then they do

	the rest of DMA transfer, for some drives if their REQ come very quick, then

	AHDI6.03 and HDX5.01 won't have the timing problem, so they can work out

	fine with those kind of drives. But for some drives if their REQ come very

	slowly, like the Syquest 88MB and IBM OEM 0663E15 1.2GM drives, then the 

	AHDI6.03 and HDX5.01 will have the timing problem which makes the AHDI6.03

	can't recognize these kind of dirves, and can't read or write the drives.

	Now, the AHDI6.03a has fixed this kind of timing problem, I wrote some codes 
	to check the REQ before continueing to do the rest of DMA transfer in 
	
	SPSCSI.S of AHDI6.03. So they can work well for Syquest 88MB and IBM OEM 
	
	0663E15 drive.
