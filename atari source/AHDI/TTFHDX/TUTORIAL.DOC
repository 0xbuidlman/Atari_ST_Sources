SELECT UNIT

     Click on the appropiate unit number, and then click  on
     OK  to  select that unit, or CANCEL to abort.  The unit
     number displayed on the screen will be  updated.   This

     until another unit  number  is  selected  using  SELECT
     UNIT.




SELECT DISK MODEL

     Click on the appropiate disk type.  If  further  selec-
     tions  are given, click on the appropiate model number.
     Click on OK to select that  disk  type,  or  CANCEL  to
     abort.   The  disk type displayed on the screen will be
     updated. This disk model will be  used  throughout  the
     FHDX session until another disk model is selected using
     SELECT DISK MODEL.




CONTROLLER TEST

     When the test is finished, the screen will either  turn
     red  if  the  disk failed the test, or stay green if it
     passed.  Hit Return or click on the message box in  the
     middle to get back to the main menu.




DAISY-CHAIN TEST

     When the test is finished, the screen will either  turn
     red  if  the  disk  failed the test (the message in the
     middle of the screen will tell  you  whether  the  disk
     failed  on  a  write error, a read error or a data com-
     parison error), or stay green if it passed.  Hit Return
     or  click  on the message box in the middle to get back

FORMAT DISK

     The format would begin as soon as you click  on  Format
     Disk  on  the  menu.  Please note that the disk will be
     partitioned after it is formatted.  The default  parti-
     tion scheme for each disk type is specified in the WIN-
     CAP file.




INPUT DEFECT LIST

(1)  If a defect list already exists, a  dialogue  box  will
     come  up  on the screen and ask if you want to keep the
     defect list that already exists.  Click on Yes to  keep
     the  current  list.   Click on No to ignore the current
     list.

(2)  A dialogue box will come up on the  screen  to  inquire
     the  type  of  tester  used  to  generate  the  defects
     recorded by the hard disk vendor.  Select  MFM  or  RLL
     and then click on Start to begin inputting, or click on
     Cancel to abort.

(3)  A form will come up on the screen with blanks for  Head
     number,  Cylinder  number and Byte offset.  Fill in the
     blanks with the  appropiate  number  from  the  defects
     recorded  by  the hard disk vendor.  To move the cursor
     through the entries, use the 'Tab' key or  the  up/down
     arrow  keys.   Click on Next (or hit 'Return') to enter
     the next defect, or click on Done when you are finished
     inputting.

(4)  A dialogue box will come up on the  screen  to  inquire
     what  to  do  next.   You  should click on 'Examine the
     defect list' if you have just  finished  inputting  the
     defects.   Click  on 'Save the defect list' to save the
     defects and leave.  Click on 'Quit without  saving'  to
     leave without saving the defects just entered.

(5)  If you have clicked on 'Examine  the  defect  list'  in
     step  4,  a  window will come up displaying the defects
     that you have just entered.  Examine each  entry  care-
     fully.   If not all of the defects are displayed, click
     on the up/down arrows or the scroll  bar  to  move  the
     content in the window up or down.

(6)  If you find an incorrect entry, click on the entry.   A
     form  will  come  up with the entered numbers.  Correct
     the wrong number(s).  Click on OK to save the corrected
     numbers, click on Delete to remove that entry, or click
     on Cancel to ignore the correction(s).  Deleted entries
     will be disabled in the defect list window.

BURN-IN TEST

(1)  The burn-in test begins as soon as  you  click  on  the
     menu entry.

(2)  A dialogue box will come up on the screen informing the
     progress  of the test.  To suspend the test, hit <ctrl-
     s>.  To  resume  the  test  after  suspending  it,  hit
     <ctrl-r>.  To quit the test, hit <ctrl-q>.

(3)  After you quit the test, the screen  will  either  turn
     red  if  the  disk failed the test, or stay green if it
     passed.  Hit 'Return' or click on the  message  box  in
     the middle of the screen to exit.

(4)  A window will then come up displaying the  defects  (in
     form of head number, cylinder number and sector number)
     that have been logged on the drive.  If there are  more
     defects  than  the  window  could  display at one time,
     click on the up/down arrows or the scroll bar  to  move
     the  content  in  the  window up or down.  Click on the
     close box on the upper left hand corner of  the  window
     or hit Return to get back to the main menu.

     to  turn  off  and  disconnect your hard disk after the
     disk heads are parked.  You MUST switch off  the  power
     of the disk once its heads have been parked.
