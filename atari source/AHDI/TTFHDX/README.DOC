FHDX 3.4 currently supports the following drives:

(1) STACY
      i) CON3021 (Conner 20Mb - CP3020)
     ii) CON3042 (Conner 40Mb - CP3040)
(2) MEGAFILE 60 -
      i) MCS5068 (Microscience 65Mb)
     ii) MSB5064 (Miniscribe 60Mb)
    iii) SEA5065 (Seagate 60Mb)
     iv) NO LABEL 60 (Miniscribe 60Mb)
(3) MEGAFILE 44 (Syquest 44Mb)
(4) MEGAFILE 30 (Seagate 30Mb)
(5) MEGAFILE 20 -
      i) SEA5020 (Seagate 20Mb)
     ii) NO LABEL 20
(6) SH205
(7) SH204
(8) SH104



The correct sequence of the test procedure is :

        Select Unit (optional) --> Select Disk Model (optional)
        --> Controller Test --> Daisy-chain Test --> Format
        --> Input Defect List (optional) --> Burn-in Test --> Ship

as displayed on the menu bar.  But, each function  can  also
be run independently in no specific order.

You only need to SELECT UNIT or SELECT DISK MODEL  when  the
current one is not what you want.  Both the current unit and
current disk model are displayed on the right hand  side  of
the menu bar.

You only need to INPUT DEFECT LIST when the  vendor  of  the
disks provide a defect list.


WARNING!!
ALL functions, EXCEPT Daisy-Chain Test and  Ship,  are  des-
tructive.   Please  be sure to back up everything (if possi-
ble) that you may want before you proceed.

Functional description of each program:
---------------------------------------

(1)  CONTROLLER TEST --

     This program tests if the controller  interacting  with
     the  drive  is functioning correctly.  If the unit is a
     SCSI drive, it will do a test unit ready on the  drive.
     If  the unit is a non-SCSI drive, it will try to format
     the drive as a 2-head, 20-cylinder and 17  sectors  per
     track device (to make it efficient).  The format param-
     eters for this test are specified in  the  WINCAP  file
     under the 'ct' entries.




(2)  DAISY-CHAIN TEST --

     This program tests if the daisy-chain port  works.   It
     will  do  a non- destructive markbad on unit 1 (for 128
     sectors, to be efficient).  The program will first save
     the  data the 128 sectors on unit 1, WRITE a worst case
     test pattern to that 128 sectors, READ data  back  from
     that  128  sectors,  VERIFY  that the data read back is
     exactly the same as what was written onto it, and WRITE
     the  original  data  back onto those 128 sectors.   The
     parameters for this test are specified  in  the  WINCAP
     file under the 'dc' entry.





(3)  FORMAT --

     This program formats the entire surface  of  the  drive
     and  creates  a  default partition when format is done.
     The default partition schemes for the different  drives
     are  specified  in the WINCAP file.  There is no FORMAT
     track command available.  This FORMAT program will  NOT
     delete  existing defective sector information logged on
     the drive earlier  (those  entered  manually  and  also
     those found during the burn-in test).  The program will
     save the defective sector information from  the  begin-
     ning  of  the  drive, format it, partition it, and then
     write the defective sector information  back  onto  the
     drive.  The FORMAT program and the PARTITION program in
     HDX 2.x (and  onwards)  will  also  save  the  existing
     defective  sector  information  logged  on the drive by
     FHDX.

(4)  INPUT DEFECT LIST --

     This program logs at the beginning of  the  drive,  the
     defects entered manually from the defect list generated
     by the vendors.  These defects  inputted  will  NOT  be
     deleted by the FORMAT program or the BURN-IN program in
     FHDX, and will NOT be deleted by the FORMAT program  or
     the PARTITION program in HDX 2.x (and onwards).





(5)  BURN-IN TEST --

     This program  tests  all  sectors  of  the  drive,  one
     cylinder at a time, in the following order -


         0, (N/4), 1, (N/4)+1, ... (N/4)-1, (N/2),
         (N/2), (3N/4), (N/2)+1, (3N/4)+1, ... (3N/4)-1, N.


     where N is the number of cylinders on the drive.   This
     order is much faster than the 0, N, 1, (N-1), 2, (N-2),
     ... order.


     The program was designed to test the cylinders  in  the
     order  specified above, so as to do seek tests combined
     with  write/read/verify  tests.   When   testing   each
     cylinder, the program will SEEK to that cylinder, WRITE
     a worst case test pattern (as specified in  the  WINCAP
     file)  to every sector on that cylinder, READ data back
     from that cylinder, and VERIFY that the data read  back
     is  exactly the same as what was written to it.  A sec-
     tor will be logged on the drive as bad if  there  is  a
     write  error, a read error or a data error on that sec-
     tor.  The program also does a  4-bit  rotation  on  the
     test  pattern  for each cycle of the burn-in test (e.g.
     For RLL drives, test pattern for  cycle  1  is  0x6333,
     test pattern for cycle 2 is 0x3633, etc...).


     All bad sectors found on a  drive  during  the  burn-in
     test will be logged at the beginning of the drive.  The
     logged defective sector information will  be  preserved
     by the FORMAT program and the INPUT DEFECT LIST program
     in FHDX, and also by the FORMAT program and the  PARTI-
     TION program in HDX 2.x (and onwards).

(6)  SHIP --

     This program parks the heads  of  a  drive.   You  MUST
     switch  off  the power of the drive once its heads have
     been parked.
