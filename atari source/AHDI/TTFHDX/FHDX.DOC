This FHDX can only partition a hard disk up to 60Mb big.  If the
capacity of the disk is greater than 60Mb, only the first 60Mb
will be accessible.

Before you try to format the disk, remember to add appropriate
'mn' and 'pr' entries in the WINCAP file.  If you still have 
questions regarding how to construct the entries after reading 
the comments in the WINCAP file, let me know what kind of drives
you are trying to format, and I'll construct the entries for you.
