Version 5.03a
=============

May-10-93	jye.	Fixed a bug that HDX can't format or partition any other

					externally connected SCSI drive when the Falcon without
					
					a internal IDE harddisk. Modified file is 'sect.c'.

Version 5.03
=============

Apr-28-93	jye.	Released a new version of HDX 5.03.

Apr-26-93 	jye.	To fixed a problem which the Gemdos writes over to next

					partition in the Falcon, one way to do it that don't need

					to change the Gemdos is to change the HDX, which writing 
					
					the 0xffff to the remain Fat table entries that do not 
					
					coresponded to the memories in the partition. So I added

					some codes in the hdx.c dsmark.c and zero.c.

Version 5.02
=============


Apr-9-1993  jye.	To fixed a problem for the Conner CP2088 drive, which HDX

					can't Markbad it in Format, because this kind of drive has

					the different values of head, cylinder, and spt between the

					physical and logical parameters, so I added a inqury() call

					right after the 'fmtunt()' in 'dodiform()' to up date the

					table, because 'fmtunt()' changes the physical parameters 

					to the logical parameters.


Version 5.01a
=============


Mar-15-93	jye: Fix a bug in the 'rescan()' of HDX5.01. If a floptical drive

			in the system, the HDX will think it is a removable drive, then 

			ingnores to check if it's also a SCSI drive, on the other words,

			forgets to set a bit in the 'typedev' flag, which later will tell

			the HDX how to do the format and partition. This bug exsit because

			HDX5.01 thinks removable drive only in the ACSI train, which is not

			true in today.

Mar-10-93	jye: change the partition size limit to 256MB in the 'stepart.c'

			file, so that it can be partition over 256MB.




Feb-15-93	jye:

1.	Later I found it was a software problem in AHDI.PRG -- The timing problem 

	between the DMA controller and the drive when handshaking after the Command
	
	or Status or Data transfer. When this kind of DMA method transfer occur,
	
	first the controller send 6 bytes of the command blocks, then do some hand-

	shaking, one of the handshaking is get the status byte, but when reading

	the status byte, have to check and wait for the REQ to come, then read the

	status byte, and the rest DMA transfer can go on to finish. For the AHDI6.03

	and HDX5.01, they didn't check and waiting for the REQ to come, then they do

	the rest of DMA transfer, for some drives if their REQ come very quick, then

	AHDI6.03 and HDX5.01 won't have the timing problem, so they can work out

	fine with those kind of drives. But for some drives if their REQ come very

	slowly, like the Syquest 88MB and IBM OEM 0663E15 1.2GB drives, then the 

	AHDI6.03 and HDX5.01 will have the timing problem which makes the AHDI6.03

	can't recognize these kind of dirves, and can't read or write the drives.


2.	Now, the AHDI6.03a and HDX5.01a have fixed this kind of timing problem, I 

	wrote some codes to check the REQ before continueing to do the rest of DMA
	
	transfer in SPSCSI.S of AHDI6.03 and in HDX5.01 too. So they can work well 
	
	for Syquest 88MB and IBM OEM 0663E15 drive.


Jan-3-93 jye:

	Killed a HDX 5.01 bug which gave some bombs when there was no wincap file

	next to the HDX.PRG. So now we can run the HDX 5.01 without the wincap file.

	Wincap file will be needed when those hard disks are not standard, for 
	
	example, HDX can't get the hard disk informations from those function call 
	
	'readcap()', 'inquiry()' and so on.



Version 5.01
=============


Aug - Oct 92


	Up date the HDX to 5.01 version so that can be used for the Falcon:


		a.	Changed the user interface to the scroll bar when selecting which

			unit is going to be done the partition or format operations.

		b.	Deleted the 'ship' operation from the HDX because the new hard

			disk will part the head automatically when turning off the power.



Dec-12-92 jye:

	Fixed a bug in the HDX5.01 so that now can be used for the SH204.

	Read AHDI source codes, and try to understand it. And try to find something 
	
	new to do.


May-23-92	jye:

	Somethings have been up date for the HDX401 to the 5.00 version.


1. 	When partition, the dialog box that asks you if the hard disk drive to 

	be formatted is an ACSI or a SCSI drive will display only if there are

	more than two different kinds, now the dialog box have three different

	kind of selections, ACSI, SCSI or IDE-AT.

	

2.	It can be used for partition or format ACSI, SCSI, IDE-AT and the 

	NOTE-BOOK.



3.	For the SCSI drive, HDX will allow to put the number of cylinders, heads

	, and sector per track into the WINCAP, when partition or format, the

	HDX will read from the WINCAP instead call the READCAP to get the hard 

	disk size, but if there are not informations in the WINCAP, the HDX will
 
	call the READCAP to get the hard disk size. The previous version assumes

	that the SCSI drive will always returns the disk size through the 

	READCAP.



4.	For the ACSI and SCSI in the ACSI bus, HDX will try to find the hard 

	disk size from the WINCAP, or MDSENSE through the page code 0 or 3 or 4,
 
	this way will make this HDX can format or partition more variety hard 

	disks.
	 

5.  Fix a bug, which was when the system has a Magafile44 in it, and there is 

	no cartridge in it, the HDX wouldn't let you do the operation for the rest

	hard disk.
