	Somethings have been up date for the HDX401 to the 5.00 version.



1. 	When partition, the dialog box that asks you if the hard disk drive to 

	be formatted is an ACSI or a SCSI drive will display only if there are

	more than two different kinds, now the dialog box have three different

	kind of selections, ACSI, SCSI or IDE-AT.

	

2.	It can be used for partition or format ACSI, SCSI, IDE-AT and the 

	NOTE-BOOK.



3.	For the SCSI drive, HDX will allow to put the number of cylinders, heads

	, and sector per track into the WINCAP, when partition or format, the

	HDX will read from the WINCAP instead call the READCAP to get the hard 

	disk size, but if there are not informations in the WINCAP, the HDX will
 
	call the READCAP to get the hard disk size. The previous version assumes

	that the SCSI drive will always returns the disk size through the 

	READCAP.



4.	For the ACSI and SCSI in the ACSI bus, HDX will try to find the hard 

	disk size from the WINCAP, or MDSENSE through the page code 0 or 3 or 4,
 
	this way will make this HDX can format or partition more variety hard 

	disks.
	 

5.  Fix a bug, which was when the system has a Magafile44 in it, and there is 

	no cartridge in it, the HDX wouldn't let you do the operation for the rest

	hard disk.
