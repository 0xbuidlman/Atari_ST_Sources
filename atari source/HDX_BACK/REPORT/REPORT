1.	Tried to find the bug in HDX.PRG 5.01a, which couldn't markbad the Conner

	CP2088 84MB drive after the format process, HDX.PRG marked the drive with
	
	thousand of bad sectors after 42MB, so HDX.PRG couldn't format the drive. 
	
	After some time of debugging, I found it was because the farmware of drive 
	
	has different kind of heads and cylinders between the physical and logical 

	values! Now, the HDX has to update the table after the format by calling the
	
	'inquiry()' one more time, so the bug has been fixed. 


2.	Release the new version of HDX 5.02 and AHDI 6.04.


3.	Tested and tried to find out the reason why the diagnostic test cargiger 

	fail in the Falcon test. And found it because the test program start at
	
	the cylinder 600, but the Conner CP2088 drive after the format, it only

	has 548 cyliners, so the read and  write will out the memory boundary.


4.	Wrote a test program to test and find out where is a bug comes from, the

	bug is, on Falcon030, writing to a partition may over write and kill next 

	partition.
