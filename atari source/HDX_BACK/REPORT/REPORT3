1.	Traced the reason why that AHDI DRIVER can't read or write to the IBM OEM 

	0663E15 drive, and found out the area that may cause the problem is: when

	the DMA controler after read and sent the data through the ACSI bus, then

	it will do some hand shake with the hard disk, and told the hard disk the

	comment block sending is finished, somehow the IBM hard disk respects more

	hand shake byte than the current ACSI comments provide to the DMA controler 

	So the hard disk just sit there and waits for the some more byte to hand 
	
	shake. When next time, the DMA controler try to do the read or write comment

	to the drive, it will fail. So I discussed this problem with John Hoenig, 
	
	and hope he can help me to find out what kind of hand shake for this kind of

	drive need in order to do a completely read or write comment. Then I can 
	
	change some low level hand shake code between the DMA controler and the 
	
	drive.


2.	Evaluated a Maxtor P1-17S hard disk drive for the Falcon SCSI-2 drive, and

	fixed a HDX 5.01 bug which can't partition a logic drive over 256MB. And 

	found out the AHDI, HDX, and Falcon SCSI-2 drive are work fine for the

	Maxtor P1-17S hard disk drive. But in about 5MB sectors after 1GB, the read 
	
	and write comment just can do it successfully, so when HDX does the markbad,
	
	HDX just treats it as the bad sector, but because it too much, so the HDX

	fail. It may be the bad sectors, or it may be the same problem as the hand
	
	shake for such IBM OME dirve. Now I don't give more time for this dirve 
	
	unless I find out those hand shake problem. But I found a way to make that
	
	drive can be worked for the Falcom SCSI-2, when do the format, skip the mark

	bad sectors, and partition some kind of scheme to avoid the those sectors 
	
	inside the partition header, then every thing will work fine. 


4.	Learn how to use the tool to check the change between the new version and

	the old one. Now, I check in all the source files for the AHDI, and in

	the future if any change to the AHDI, I can use the tool to chack what

	kind of changes that have done. I'll do this to the HDX and PIXVDI too.


3.  Set up a system for the PIXVDI so that I can build the SCREEN.PRG and

	SMSCREEN.PRG.
