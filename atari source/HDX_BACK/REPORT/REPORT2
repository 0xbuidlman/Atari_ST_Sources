1.	Killed a HDX 5.01 bug which gave some bombs when there was no wincap file

	next to the HDX.PRG. So now we can run the HDX 5.01 without the wincap file.

	Wincap file will be needed when those hard disks are not standard, for 
	
	example, HDX can't get the hard disk informations from those function call 
	
	'readcap()', 'inquiry()' and so on.



2. 	Evaluated a Conner CP2088 hard disk drive for the Falcon IDE dirve for 

	Richard Miller.



3.  Evaluated 3 other hard disk dirves with for the Falcon SCSI-2 drive, and

	found out two hard disks, Fujisu and Toshiba, can be used as the Falcon

	SCSI-2 drive with some kind of set up. But for the IBM OEM 0663E15 drive, 
	
	the AHDI DRIVER can't read or write to it, neither the HDX can format it. 
	
	So now I try find out the reasons why HDX can't format it, and I also 
	
	continue to evaluate the IBM OEM drive and try to find out the reasons why
	
	AHDI can't read or write to it, but at the same time, I'm getting know 
	
	more about the AHDI driver.
