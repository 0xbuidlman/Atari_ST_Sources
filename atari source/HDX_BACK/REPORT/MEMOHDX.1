	HDX 5.02 up date:




	1.	Fixed a bug that can't markbad the Conner CP2088 drive in format in

		the Falcon computer.



	2. 	Fixed a bug which when re-partition a drive with a partition over 

		256MB, the HDX 5.01 won't let you do it. But this bug won't show up

		if you format the drive. In format, it will divide a drive to 4 equal

		partitions which can over 256MB in size.



	3.	Fixed a timing bug that couldn't read or write to some drives in the

		Falcon computer. For example, SyQuest 88MB, IBM OME 0663E15 1.2MB

		drives.



	4. 	Fixed a bug which gave the bomb when there was no Wincap file next to 

		HDX.PRG.
