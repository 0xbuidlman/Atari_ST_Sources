---------------------------------------------------------------------------




	Ease of Hardware Setup:					Very Good

	Ease of Software Installation:			Very Good

	Comprehensiveness of Manual:				Very Good

	Quality of Technical Support:				Very Good

	Driver 6.03:							Works well

	Hdx	6.00:							Works well

	Read/Write:							faster than CP2044PK

	Overall Performance:					Very Good





	Note:

	1.	For the Hdx 6.00 evaluation, I did the big partitions, for example, 
	
		only one big partition with 80 Mb in the hard disk. For the extended 
		
		partition test, I divided the hard disk over 14 partitions. For all 
		
		of these tests, the results were very good.


	2.	For the read/write test, I moved and copied the files between the 

		partitions, and then I ran some executable files that I just copied
		
		and moved around, for example, the DRIVER.PRG and the HDX.PRG. The 
		
		results were very good.
