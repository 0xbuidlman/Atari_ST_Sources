1.	Evaluated the INSITE I235VM Floptical Drive for Falcon SCSI 2, and found

	out: When format the drive, HDX can't write to the drive. 


2.	I used the DB.prg to find out the reason why HDX can't write to the drive,

	I got this: when write command finished the sending through the DMA bus,

	the last thing to do was waiting for the status byte from the drive, but
	
	the drive returned the 2 as a status byte, non zero byte return meaned the
	
	writing was not successful. When I did the read command to the same sector,
	
	the read was successful, and I found the stuffs I read back were differ from

	the things I tried to write to that sector, so I concluded that the write 
	
	was indeed failed. Now I'm waiting for comprehensive menu of that drive from

	the manufacture, so that I can learn more about the way how to talk to this 
	
	kind of drive, then I can find out the real reasons.


3.	Helped the testing group guys to find out the reason why they couldn't set 

	up the Falcon system for the testing.


4.	Now I read the Atari ACSI/DMA User Guide Menu so that I can understand more

	about the those 'handshake' stuff between the DMA Controler and the periphe-

	rals, this will help me to find those bugs that relate to the 'handshake'. 

	So far, I found those drives couldn't be used as the Falcon SCSI 2 were all
	
	having the 'handshake' problem with the DMA port.
