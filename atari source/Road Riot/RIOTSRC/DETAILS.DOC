Road Riot Details:

The Road Riot screen on the arcade game was 336 pixels wide by 240 pixels
high.  The playfield and motion objects can have up to 6 bits per pixel.

The sizes of the pieces of the arcade game are:
			 program:            512k bytes.
			 audio program        64k bytes.
			 audio data          512k bytes.
			 graphic data       2900k bytes.

These size estimates are based on the sizes of the EPROMS used to hold the
program or data. In some cases (such as the program roms), the roms may
not have been 'full'. (These sizes may look large from a 'home game' 
standpoint, but I don't think they are any larger than 'Pitfighter' was.)
Much of the graphic data consists of pictures of the players' car and its
wheels from a wide variety of angles.

For a two player game, I would suggest splitting the screen into two halves - 
have one player on the top half of the screen and one on the bottom half.
This gives each player their own set of scan lines , which allows the code to 
do the scan line shifting needed to get the road to curve for each player.
 
The program is written in about 90 % C and 10 % 68000 assembly.  There are a lot
of assembly files used in the program, but these are usually track data files
or graphics data files.

The source code provided contains all of the code used in the game except
for some code that was considered to be specific to the arcade
implementation  - such as low level driver and animation code, copy 
protection code, coin collection routines, and self test code.  The 
essentials of the game are there - the car model code, the drone control 
code, the main loop code, and the descriptions of the tracks.

If you have any more questions just let me know.
