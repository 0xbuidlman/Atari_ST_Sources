FSM Control Panel Extension Release Notes
October 1, 1990
===========================================================================

The FSM CPX is used to modify the EXTEND.SYS required by FSM-GDOS.
To execute the FSM CPX, double-click on the Font Manager CPX in the 
Control Panel.

Before being displayed in the window, the CPX will search for the
EXTEND.SYS file on the startup device.  This will be either A:\ or C:\.
The information in the file will be used as the current attributes of 
the CPX.  For example, the fonts found in the EXTEND.SYS file will be 
displayed in the active menu of the CPX.  In addition, the CPX will search
the Font Path specified by the EXTEND.SYS to locate all of the
available fonts which will be displayed in the inactive font menu.
Symbol and Hebrew Fonts will NOT be displayed in either menu.

If the EXTEND.SYS file doesn't exist, the attributes will be set to their
defaults.  For example, the Font Path Default will be "C:\".
