Babel 0.6 beta
==============

To install the supplied binary, just copy it to anywhere convenient on your
hard disc. You should then create a news directory. It can be:

	a directory called "news" in the root of the drive containing babel.
	a directory called "news" inside the directory containing babel.
	the babel directory itself - not recommended.
	any other directory, if you set the environment variable $NEWSDIR

In that directory there ought to be a file called "active". That should be
written by the newsreader for you (*** but the current alpha version of
firenews won't, so you'll have to do it yourself). If you need to write or
edit it yourself, (or you want to write a newsreader!) the file active.txt
or active.5 describes the format.

Compiling babel
---------------
The makefile will probably need editing so it uses the correct command for
your compiler. As distributed, it uses "cgcc" which is what I use to
cross-compile Atari programs from my linux PC.

Once that is correct, typing make in a CLI, or double clicking on make.prg
with the babel source directory the current directory, will compile and link
babel.

If you don't have "make" with your compiler, you will need to set up
a project file of some kind yourself. "stik-interface.c" needs to be
compiled with short integers, for the other files it doesn't matter but I
used long (32-bit) integers.

The only portability problem I can see is the GEM stuff; Lattice C's gem
libary uses different names for the header files and declares many
parameters as short where they are int in the GNU library. I believe the GNU
library is generally much closer to Atari's original specs.

Any problems, email me on mbaker@iee.org and I'll probably be totally unable
to help. You know how it is :)
