The GEM-list keyboard standard (more or less agreed to years ago and used 
mostly by the Germans but also by others) uses CNTL-D for Diminish a window, 
that is, iconify.

There was an Atari standard keyboard short-cut list which hardly any one 
adopted. I think the list in TAC and MASS is this one.

However, this list already conflicted with standards emerging from Germany
and so a group of commercial, shareware and PD programmers got together on
the Internet in 1994 to agree on an alternative set of keyboard equivalents
which became known as the GEM-List Keyboard Short-cut Standard.
