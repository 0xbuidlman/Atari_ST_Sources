Possibly.

You'd have to write some code to insert relevent data into one of the
buffers used by Kbdvbase() and have some scheme whereby you could tell
it was really midi data when the app received it.

An easier and (imo) better solution would be to send the midi data
straight to your application via appl_write().

Judging from the replies, it looks like EXIST doesn't set a DTA

In all the projects I have used the _hash function in (see my CPXs on my web
site) I know what the data file is as I construct it :-) and I run it through
a test program first to make sure that there are no duplicate hash values.
I've no idea what algorithm they chose but so far so good :-)

Can you explain how this would be done?

How does appl_write() distinguish between different types of data?

Greetings,  FPK-Pascal (FPC), can now correctly produce m68k code, i'd like
to know if someone would be interested in porting the run-time-library to the
Atari... In all cases, an Amiga binary version should be available within
weeks. Please contact me via e-mail if interested.

In 1988/89 I was running X11R3 on a 4MB Sun 3/50 (68020 based UNIX
workstation) and other Sun 3 machines.  There is no problem running X
in 4MB.  Of course I don't know how big a footprint MiNT has (my Mega
4ST has been in storage for a few years).

Does anyone know how to use WF_KIND() to add window elements to an 
existing window?

I want to add a vertical slider and arrows to an existing (and open) 
window.  I'm using the GFA call 

      ~WIND_SET(handle,1,&X111001011,0,0,0)
            
Theoretically this should do the trick, but nothing happens.  I've 
tried closing the window first then reopening it, doing a redraw...

I could delete the window and then create a new one, but I'd prefer to 
just change the existing one.

I wonder if a GEM-window can have another borderwidth than 1 pixel?
If so,

	* What AES is capable of handling this?
	* How can I find out the current width?
	* How do I set border width value?

Xref: news.alfaskop.net comp.sys.atari.st.tech:3417 comp.sys.atari.programmer:2134

Are there any scancodes defined for the extra keys present on some
keyboards (I am looking at a AT keyboard), for example the F11 and F12
keys, End, Page up, Page down, Scroll lock, Num lock, Print Screen and
Pause. Also some newer keyboards have a few extra keys as well, such as
the "Windows" key.

If there are not any scancodes assigned to these keys, how should they be
handled on such a keyboard? What should keys like Scroll lock and Num lock
do? What does Scroll lock do on a normal IBM compatible?

With Num lock I could make it simply return number keys when on or
arrow/alternative keys when off on the number pad, is this the correct
behaviour, or will this be handled by TOS if I make Num lock send the
correct scancode? If the latter, how should I know when to turn the num
lock light on the keyboard on and off?

As for caps lock, the computer can at any time change the state of the
caps lock without telling the keyboard, I believe, so is there any way I
can know what state the caps lock light should be in (on or off) at any
time?

(I'm talking from the point of view of the keyboard.)

Thank you for any hints.

The border around the window can be any width. Your application software
doesn't have to know how wide it is, but you can find out by using
wind_get. The original Atari AES never used a border wider than 1 pixel,
and there's no way to set that. If some other AES does allow that size to
be configured, you would have to look at the documentation for the
particular program, since there's no standard way of doing it. Application
software doesn't need to worry about the border width anyhow.

Hi-

I have some Atari Hardware/Software I need to dispose of.  Here is a
partial list.  Please respond with email since I dont read these news
groups.

32 bit stuff
Atari Falcon 030 (4mb) (HD Drive)

16 bit stuff
Atari 1040 ST  (4mb) (DD drive)
Atari SC1224 Monitor
Atari SLM 804 Laser Printer
Atari SC1224 Color Monitor
Atari SF254 SD Disk Drive
ICD SCSI Controller Card
Practical Solutions Mouse Master (Joystick / Mouse Switch)
2 Alfa Data Mice for Atari / Amiga  (Very good mouse)
Home made box to allow use of VGA monitor with an Atari computer.  Has
high/low resolution switch

8 bit stuff
Atari 65XE (Computer)
Atari 1010 Tape Drive
Rana Systems 1000 Double Density Disk Drive
2 Atari 1050 Disk Drives (1.5 Density)
1 Atari 1050 Disk Drive - Not Working - Parts Only 
ICD PR: Connection (Parallel and Two Serial Ports)
Atari Xmm 801 printer
Nec Composite monitor.  About 13 inches.  Green Display.

I simply dont have room for this old computer stuff, so I need to get
rid of it.  All offers will be considered, but trades for PC hardware
will be given first priority.  I have a lot of software, books and
cables that I have not cataloged yet, if you want something in
particular I will let you know if I have it.  I live in Columbus Ohio,
USA.  
 
Thank you
John Wagner

AFAIK, this is not implemented, at least not in any builtin AES upto TOS
3.x.

Why

AFAIK Alpha processors are manufactured by Digital which is now owned by
Compaq and they're the one who own the technology. Judging from your
conversation Intel have bought or licenced Alpha technology, is this true?
If that's the case, where can I find more information about this since I
have obviously missed something.

But this copy part is ridiculous, Intel needs the latest in technology just
because of their efforts to keep the old structure and concept they used in
the Intel x86 processors. A concept dating back more than Intel CPU's and
that was great ... back in the 80's in the first Z80 home computers. Today
Alpha and PowerPC processors are way ahead if you compare the ratio between
technology used and performance given. Intel has often used better
technology if you look at plain electronics involved. Still they get
outperformed by relatively simple and cheap RISC processors.

  Hi,
 I'm trying to compile some code using SozobonX 2.05 (?I think). The
code will compile with the default (-mshort) int size, but if I compile
with -mlong, the code bus errors somewhere during C startup, before
main is entered. (Looks like somewhere during or slightly after parsing
the environment variables, in MonST). I'm running on an Atari TT/030,
TOS 3.06.
  Is the -mlong option just broken, or do I need to include special libs,
or what?
 

 Thanks,
  -Russ

I would think that the Alphas only did the rendering, so it shouldn't be to hard to
port a
renderer to it. The editing probably took place one something else.

If anyone's interested in picking up the Abacus Software series of
books on the Atari ST, I've put a couple up on the ebay auction site.


If there's enough interest I'll post more of the series, as well as
some 68000 assembly language books.

It's in the GFA manual at least...

There are some programs around (like KIVI QWK) that allow you to 
customize window elements on the fly.  I would imagine that WF_KIND is 
used for this purpose, unless there's another call that I haven't come 
across.

In KIVI the change of window elements is very smooth and it sure 
doesn't seem like the window is being deleted and then re-created with 
new elements.  How do I do this?

It's also in the Abacus GEM programmers reference and Compute!'s Technical
reference guide Atari ST: AES, so it has been documented. I wonder if it's
in the Compendium, anyone with a copy care to look and see?

It was several months ago. I read it in a mag, so I probably won't find the
mention of it.

WF_KIND used to be listed as a parameter to wind_set() and wind_get()
earlier on (pre-1990). 

	ie "wind_set( handle, WF_KIND, NAME|CLOSER|MOVER, ...)"

I can vaguely recall seeing it listed in the (circa 1986) Megamax C
manual. 

And WF_KIND is still #defined in the Lattice C 5.60 aes.h file, but isn't
defined in either the v5.06 (ring-bound! one function to a page! hooray!)
or the 5.60 (perfect bound. many-funcs per page. boo!) manuals. 

	#define WF_KIND         1

What does it say about it in these two books?  I really would like to 
use something that could change window elements on the fly.  CAB does 
it, KIVI does it...how do they do it?

According to reports (years ago) in this forum you can have X with an

about it. MiNT itself is not the problem. The Xservers I have here are
sized in the range 2.5 - 3.5 megabyte. I'd guess that the one for ST is
about the same size.

Not true.

Compaq and Digital has merged and they have only signed a deal with Intel
to let Intel manufacture the Alpha processor. Intel doesn't own anything,
they will just produce the chip which will let them double the performance
until year 2000 with Intels tehnology (0.18 micron).

I don't know about KIVI, but CAB uses "faked" window gadgets. It's not
real window gadgets, but self build which acts just like the real thing.

It isn't possible at this time. Not in TOS. Not in MagiC. Not in N.AES.

CAB uses its own window elements (because of Frames).

Hi there,
        along time ago there was this cool little hand held console
called the Lynx. Unfortunately it was too bulky and had too short a
battery life and was discontinued.

The Lynx Development kit was little box from a company called Epyx,
who originaly designed the "Handy" console (a.k.a. Lynx), and the
engineers also worked on the original Amiga!!!

This little box, called Howard I think, linked to the Amiga via the
parallel port.

I was wondering if anyone had one of these development kits and the
software, possibly in a dusty corner somewhere....

Perhaps your company did Lynx development and you have a couple of
devkits in the warehouse gathering dust??

I'd really like to get hold of one, so if you have one get in touch

Cheers
Alex Holland

P.s. I dont read Usenet too often so email me direct could you??

I believe there was once a commerical magazine called '"ST World"
which was the first of the ST Mags to die. Is there anyone who can
provide me with some info about it including a screenshot of the cover
in Gif format? I want to write an article on it and I need to know...

1. What year (and month if known) was the first issue released?
2. What year (and month if known) was the last issue released?
3. Why did it cease publication.
4. General info about the contents IE: tutorials ran, regular features
(news, PD Reviews, other reviews etc).

I would be grateful if anyone could give me as much info as possible
on this.
 
Note: I am talking about ST World and not Atari World, two different
magazines.

Geneva can give you complete access to the OBJECT tree which makes
up a particular window frame.  I've used this feature to replace the
FULLER button.  Needless to say, the code is not portable.

It's not possible, Linux and MiNT use different protocols for IP on
the parallell-port. Unfortunelately the ST's (and all other models for
that matter) parallell-port doesn't support all signals used in
Linux-PLIP, so Linux will have to adapt to MiNT in this case...

According to both Compute!'s AES and GEM programmers, it's supposed to set
the window control flags, as you'd think it should do, although from the
returned value when trying it out, it doesn't exist.

The only thing I can think of, and it's a wild guess, is that these two,
and some other manuals and programming guides, took the info from the
PC-GEM docs rather from what had been implemented in ST-GEM.

Hello,

I'm a french owner of an atari mega Ste

1) ****** I'm looking for softwares for it *******


I'm looking for

TRAX Recording Studio Utilities
    (Tracksheet plus)
    by Quentin Rice
    (c) Quinsoft 1990


I had a demo of this and I'll like to buy the full version.

(It allows you to print a cue list, a track sheet, a mix sheet and you can
store the names and adress of the consummers and musicians in a database.)


I also looking for :
-'Studio module' for Cubase V3.0 Atari.
- Dr T's XOR (Universal Patch Librarian for Synth's sounds)
- other Editor/patch/Librarian witch is fully compatible with
Notator/softlink and can manage sounds of Roland D70 and Yamaha SY99


2) ****** I'm looking for a programmer on Atari St********

2.1) If I can't find Trax (see above...)
I'll like to have a soft for manage a small recording studio


2.2) the 2nd software must be faster because :

It must be able to show 41 differents "midi control changes" on one screen
like 41 bar graph.


The control changes are showing the moves of the faders of an automated
mixing console Tascam M3700. For each fader (32+8+1=41) the console send 3
midi bytes like :

-in midi :  Controlchange,fader n°,Value
-in hexa :  Bn,yy,xx   where 'n' is the midi channel (0h to Fh), 'yy' is the
number of the fader (00h to 25h), 'xx' the level of the fader (00h to 7Fh)
-in deci : 176+(n),yy,xx    where 'n' is the midi channel (0 to 16), 'yy' is
the number of the fader (0 to 41), 'xx' the level of the fader (0 to 127)


I tried with the cubase midimixer but there is 3 problems :

-1) The fist fader send a CTRL CHGE n°0 and this is not reconize by Cubase
-2) Because of the size of the cubase's faders, you can't see 41 faders in
the same time on the screen (you must scroll the bars)
-3) I already use midimixer's objects for FX programming and I can use only
127 object simultaneously

I don't know if some software for other mixing consoles can work (Allen &
Heath,
Soundtracks, Soundcraft ??...) I'm specialy thinking about 'Spirit Auto'
Software or 'big by langley'.

Vincent,

This is a real nice accounting program that was special made for the 
recording studio.  I have run the demo, sometime back and it looked super!

I didn't get it because my business didn't warrant it.  The demo was on
Genie which is now becoming part of the www.  FWIW

Studio Manager - Invoice/Accounting v 1.xx

PRESS RELEASE

       We are pleased to announce the commercial-release debut of

               STUDIO MANAGER - INVOICE/ACCOUNTING

       With the availablity of an inexpensive yet powerful computer 
platform like the Atari ST, the concept of a computer-based studio
management 'system' seemed the obvious way to handle the various
'chores' that exist in the operations of a recording studio.
       Armed with a handful of commercial and public domain 
programs we went 'computerized'.  With a stack of manuals to learn
and assortment of floppy disks we shuffled through the patchwork.
After two years of trying this and that, it was concluded that we
have actually create MORE work for ourselves.

       We are music people trying to compete in the business world.
We were busy studying our craft, be it music theory, arranging,
MIDI sequencing or acoustics and recording techniques.
       We also wanted everything that left the studio to be of the
best quality we could provide; from real-time cassette dubs to
our client's invoice statement.       

       With a 'vision' greater than our budget, the decision was
made to barter long days and nites at the computer in designing 
software to address the unique needs of the recording studio business
and, thereby, help us in our overall pursuit.    We were surely no
stranger to this type of schedule, and the parallels between music
production and software development provided pleasant revelations.
       From a humble beginning, the 'INVOICE' program developed
into a essential tool that was used daily in studio operations.
       When other studio people who, looking over our shoulder
or just 'checking out the computer scene', showed positive interest
in using the 'INVOICE' program for their business,  the decision
was made to redesign the program architecture to work for any 
studio.   We also gave it a name at that point.
       In what was to be a complete source code re-write for the next 
generation of 'STUDIO MANAGER',  with all new logic, features and a new
graphic user interface, the motto 'UP ALL NITE' became our theme song.

       For some, the closest experience with a keyboard was either
a synthesizer or a typewriter, so the program had to be intuitive,
easy to learn, and quick.


Documentation notes:

       If I told you about one of the more difficult parts of writing
this software package,  it could easily be the documentation.
       When I called on some of the various users of the program to 
assist in the doc writing process, they laughed saying who needs 
docs for the program ... it's self-explanatory.  Of course, that
was one of the fundamental concept that went into the design, so that
may help explain some of the difficulties.  The 'other' reason was the
amount of features within the program that everyone had just grown
accustomed to.   Fair enough,  but while the time drag on during 
the doc writing sessions, I began adding requested features that 
were scheduled for the next version upgrade.  
       We decided that the outline approach to describe the operation
of the program would serve the best beginning.
       Other decisions had to do with the final 'form' of the docs.
The spectrum of choices boiled down to either pre-printed booklets
or the standard ASCII text file on disk. 
       So, the decision:  we go the text file route and offer a
special introductory price for a limited time.  The user base can
help us in making these, and other decision.  As for the 'docs' issue,
if it is concluded that pre-printed is the way to go, then every 
registered user will receive them.  The expanded user base, along 
with the on-line support, should provide us insight as to how both 
the documentation (and software!) should mature.

       At the very least, we hope that you find Studio Manager v 1.xx
has the basic foundation you've sought in a working solution for
your business of music.
       I hope that you will join us! 

                                       Sincerely,

                                                   Ron    



Future program development:
  This being the debut commercial release of STUDIO MANAGER v 1.xx 
we have tried to provide a foundation base program to handle the 
immediate needs of the recording studio business.
  The design for future versions will be based upon request from 
the users as to new features and functions to be implemented.
  Aside from the Invoice/Accounting system, other studio related 
support programs in development include:
  A client Fone Book database, Scheduling Calendar, Track Sheets,
Tape Labeling and Pre-Production modules.

I am trying to write some user manuals and readme files, using Atari Works. 

If I select "Export file" from the menu, and then choose "plain ASCII", I
get a file containing a number of _very_ long lines (200-300 characters or
more) for each paragraph. (read: each paragraph becomes one long line of 
ASCII)

Is there some source code somewhere I can use to read and translate the
STW file that Atari Works saves its text into, into 70-ish width lines? 
Or is there a utility I can use? 

Doing so by hand, using an ASCII editor (like the one included in Devpac,
Lattice etc) is tedious when the files get lengthy.

ByteTight Computer Security Corporation in  Palm Harbor,
Florida held a press conference Tuesday afternoon to
demonstrate their newly developed software
( Hacker Proof 98 ). This software is the solution to
a Major Security Hole on the Internet for Windows 95,
98 & NT machines.

During the demo, NBC News asked Mr. Paris to scan their
local NBC computer network to test the hole on their
computers. At this time, there were four machines that
were connected to the Internet.  Out of these four
computers, Mr. Paris was able to connect to one news
editor's computer. Everyone during and after the demo
was convinced and astounded at what they saw.  In spite
of this demo, Microsoft has flatly responded in a
Newbytes article that there is no such bug and that the
Windows 95 OS had "ample" security against hackers.

A random IP block of 254 IP addresses were scanned at
the conference.  Out of these 254 addresses, 50 were
connected to the Internet or in use with Windows 95,
98 & NT.  All at once, remote computer desktop's started
popping up all over on the demo machine monitor (about
15 in all).  Most of these seemed to be home computers
with names like, "Mom's C: drive" and  "Dad's Removable
Drive".

When the same demo was tested on a local machine that
had Hacker Proof 98 installed on it, we were disconnected
immediately and were not allowed access to the machine
or any of its' files!  Hacker Proof 98 was designed and
developed to provide the highest level of protection for
every Internet user and all their personal information
stored on their computer.  A user can specify who can
access their computer and will be warned when and if
any intruders get access.  These are just some of the
many features that Hacker Proof 98 has to offer the
computer security industry.

Mr. Paris proved that this is a serious problem. There
is a major part of the Internet open to this security
hole! Thirty percent of the computers tested were
accessible.  There are 80 million computers connected
to the Internet around the globe. This means that
24 million computers could be open to hackers!

An Internet Service Provider Security Consultant
(Jason Staples) conducted another test in the Seattle,
Washington area.  He told NewsBytes he tested the IP
addresses of 200 dial-up users at his Internet Service
Provider. There is no way of knowing how many dial-up
users were connected to the Internet at that time.
However, he claimed 1.5% of the computers were
accessible. Even with 1.5%, this still leaves
1.2 Million computers that could be accessed by
hackers or people using hacking programs. 

This hole is nothing new to users that have been
around the Internet for a while or for people that work
regularly with computer networking.  However, one of
the largest hacking sites on the Internet is now putting
up files that seek out these computers and connect to them. 

In Mr. Paris's demo, he used one such program and
connected to 15 computers and had full access into their
hard drives in a total time of two minutes!

This is a serious problem that the public needs to know
about.  This is not a BUG in the Windows program, but
rather one of  the largest security holes we've ever
seen on the Internet.  This was not a large issue when
very few users were on the Internet.  But now with the
population growing so rapidly, and with a large lack of
understanding on the major part of the Internet community,
this is a major issue.  The problem and the knowledge of
it is growing astronomically.  As of today, Rootshell
has added two more programs that have taken this security
hole even further!

These hacker programs now include many different
applications that help not only hackers, but anyone that
can download the programs (which can be anyone) to hack
into computers around the globe.  These programs include:


1.   PLUG-IN FOR CHAT ROOMS
This plug-in is found within "WinHackGold." It allows anyone
that goes into a chat room on the Internet to right click
on a user name and then connect right into their hard drive.
The second plug-in allows the user to right click on the
channel and connect to every accessible user's hard drive in
the chat room at once!

2.   MASS EXPLOIT ENTIRE INTERNET BY CLASS C BLOCK
WinHackGold also uses the UNIX OS to search a range of IP
addresses on the entire Internet by Class C Blocks (254 IP
Addresses) for connected Windows machines.  It takes about
one minute to find an average of  50 machines.  Then it
creates a batch file that can be run with a Windows command.
As the file is being run, it is connecting to all of the
machines that have their hard-drive open. (On average we
count about 12-15 computers.)

3.   LEGION IS A WINDOWS 95 PROGRAM THAT SCANS
     MULTIPLE CLASS C BLOCKS!
Legion by Rhino 9 Software, is a program that searches for
vulnerable computers, but this one works right within Windows.
It will allow you to search 254 Class C's at a time while
viewing in a separate window all the information about the
computers  that are accessible.  This includes drives, names
of drives, computer workgroup names, IP addresses, and other
information.  After the program is run, you can log into any
machine that appears to have the type of information you
would want to access.

4.   EMBEDDED WEBPAGE PROGRAM - MAJOR THREAT
A hacker site put up a program for users to click on that
tells them if their computer is open for attack.  it will
automatically warn them and display their information right
there online. This was a nice gesture, but this now opens
another door to the problem.  This program now can be added
to ANY web page on the Internet and 'secretly' ran without
your knowledge.  Instead of displaying your information,
it can write or mail your information somewhere else.  It
could also be modified simply to look for files when you
log onto any page, such as zip, dat, or dbf  files. It can
continue to download your files EVEN AFTER YOU LEAVE THE
PAGE.  So in reality, all you would need to do is visit
the page one time, look at the front page and close your
browser.  As long as your Internet connection is still made,
they can download your confidential data files. Given that
the programs described exist, apparently ByteTight is not
the only one taking this Major Security Hole seriously.

To date, this is what's on the Internet from what we can
see, but this has all happened in a short time.  From
everything that has transpired, there will be many more
programs like these mentioned above coming out every week
or two.  If the public is not warned and measures aren't
taken, people will be surfing in places where they have
no right to be (maybe on your hard drive).

ByteTight Computer Security Corp. has set up a demo
computer on the Internet for users to see just how their
computer information could be accessed if a hacker was
to connect to them.  To experience this security hole
firsthand, come and try our on-line demo
at:  http://www.hackerproof98.com

We are also open to demonstrate this hole to any member
of the press, also we will welcome telephone interviews
Phone: ( 813 ) 784 - 2954.  Please help the public to
understand what is going on in the Internet world and
how it can affect them.

Hello,

Does anybody know a place on the web where I can find some useful
C-libraries for my Atari ST? 

Especially some menu, and other user-interface libs will probably help
me.

If anyone's interested in picking up the Abacus Software series of
books on the Atari ST, I've put a couple up on the ebay auction site.


If there's enough interest I'll post more of the series, as well as
some 68000 assembly language books.

Hello,

Thanks for the reply

The software look (looked ?) Great ! I 'll like to find it... but where ???

Does anyone know if there is a web site or an email where I'll find some
more informations (price, ordering...)

Thanks again.

Hello everyone,

	I'm writing a disk utility program in GFA BASIC 3.5E. I was
wondering if anyone knows or could show me some sample code on how to do
any of the following...

(1) Read the disk FATS table and decifer it.
(2) Read how many directories and files are on the disk
(3) Read/Change the disk lable
(4) Probably some formating routines 

	I really need to find a rountine for the FATS table. I want to be
able to find system and hidden files. I also need to find clusters,sectors
e.t.c. Also files which have been deleted but their data is still on the
disk.

Thank's

Scott.

Use sector read routines to read the FAT.

Use Fsfirst-Fsnext.

Read the directory sector change name write the sector.

Use the OS format routines.

System and hidden files are found using Fsfirst Fsnext. No need 
for FAT's overhere. Maybe you should first read some documentation 
about the file system before even thinking about tinkering with 
the filesystem. A good place to start is
http://www.komkon.org/fms/MSX/Docs/Disk.txt
which looks like a part of the ST discdoc program.

Maybe you should also browse the disk with a sector editor 
so you can learn how things fit together. One of the best 
dikeditors ever is (IMHO) norton diskedit. Don't worry 
about it being a DOS program because the filesystem 
structures are exactly the same. Try to learn about 
the diskstructures with that program.

Succes, Hans Wessels

That should probably just be FAT (FAT = "File Allocation Table").

Easy. Just step through all the dirs recursively...

Shouldn't be too hard, there's even a GFA-call that can do that IIRC.

Check out some docs on XBIOS calls if you can find them...

You'll want to get at least the Atari GEMDOS manual, which has an appendix
dedicated to FAT-fs structure. It should be on most of the good Atari FTP
sites (I think Umich as wel...) or else try my page (see below, and hope the 
link is still valid...)

This upsets me. The Amiga kernel is central to its efficiency and
general behaviour. Using another kernel will make it somwething else

I'm uncertain, they've stated that they bought Amiga for its

I'd say it's neither or a little of both.

If the Amiga can, why not the PC? And how do you know this isn't

I welcome all alternatives, but I want to keep the Amiga alive, and
I'm not sure that Gateway are planning to produce an Amiga.

If available, one should always use Dopendir(), Dreaddir() and
Dclosedir() to scan a directory. I posted an example here some time ago.

Also note that Fsfirst()/Fsnext() on VFAT partitions with SingleTOS
(i.e. without VFAT enabled) sometimes find the VFAT entries, which is a
bad thing. There are two ways to avoid that: Put HideVFAT into your
Auto-folder (I'll make that available tomorrow), or put a workaround
into your programs, like this:

fret = Fsfirst("C:\*.*", 0x17);
while (fret ==0)
{
    if (dta.d_attrib == 0xf) /* Is it a VFAT entry? */
        continue; /* Yes, so skip it */
    /* Do something with the file */
    fret = Fsnext();
}


Ciao

What do you mean by the sector read routines? Are you talking about
BIOS/XBIOS parameter blocks?

Ok I was thinking about that, but what about the directories and files
within directories. FSFIRST-NEXT only reads from the current directory, so
this means whenever the loop incounters a folder, it would have to change
to that directory and check its contents and so forth. Is there another
way? Could I use the FATS table for this purpose. Just read it and count
the file ends.

So the disk lable is stored on a sector on the disk. So its just a read
and write routine to that sector.

What do you mean by OS format routines? Do you mean XBIOS(10)?

Thanks for the address, I'll have look.  Also thank's for the quick

You could do so, but of course it's nothing to use in an application,
but only in a special disk utility which checks whether the partition
it's reading from is really a FAT one.

: So the disk lable is stored on a sector on the disk. So its just a read
: and write routine to that sector.

To be precise, the disk label for a FAT filesystem is stored in the root
directory as a filename with attribute 0x8 (so, if one is set, it may be
located in any of the root directory's sectors). Simply use
Fsfirst("*.*", 0x8) (or Dreadlabel(), if available) to read it, and
Fcreate(labelname, 0x8) (or Dwritelabel(), if available) to set/change
it. No need to use low-level-stuff for that.


Ciao

Thomas

Greetings Atarians!

How do you (In GFA code) read incoming mididata?

Is there a way to check that the Midi-port really is present, without
making the
system hang, if so isn´t the case?



	Regards,

One of the first big MiNT distributions, the TAF-kit, came with X11 as default
GUI. It works nicely on a 4meg ST. But lemme get this discussion straight,
so far the line was that an Amiga can do anything an Alpha can do in Linux
because an Amiga will run Linux as well, but that this doesn't go for Ataris
because MiNT isn't fully Linux compatible? Are we forgetting that Linux will
run on an Atari as well? (And, again, that X will also work under MiNT).

	It may not necessarily go for MiNT.

	That does not address Atari in general.

	A Falcon will quite happily run Linux and could 
	quite happily contribute to a D2 render farm
	right beside an Ameboa, an Alpha, a Sidewinder
	or any other supported platform...

Use INP?(3) to check if there's data available at the MIDI port and 
read the data with INP(3).

Hi All,

I was wondering if anybody out there knows if there is a C++ compiler
for the Atari platform?  I can't think of any GEM C++ compilers, but
perhaps there is a MiNT version of the GNU C++ compiler?

Thanks.

Regards,

Ben Hills.

Correct, gcc is ported to MiNT/TOS/MagiC. It's available (with libs)
from all good ftp-sites. Try 'ftp.funet.fi/pub/atari/piwo-mint/Gcc'

Hi I am having a prob (as usual) with my evnt_multi() with the
avserver message it could send me.

ok: it says here on my manual that if I put addr_buffer (in the
evnt_multi()) = 0 it will check for menu(1) to menu(8) mu_mesag.

The thing is< how do I check if I get a message from the avserver?
the ideal would be to put addr_buffer in the evnt_multi and then i
woul dbe able to check that. But then all the regular aes messages
won't be seen at all.

Clear enough?
thanks :)

   I am thinking of adapting some existing tools (the c68/jas compiler
and assembler) for a personal project, and I might also need to create
a simple custom linker.
   I've looked around a bit and I haven't been able to find the
definition for DRI object files. Is this documented anywhere? (For
Motorola 68k object code)

  Thanks in advance,
  -Russ Magee

Every so often, whilst debugging some code I've written, I see the 68k
instruction "cmp.w #$c9,d0" in the start of the code that handles the GEM
trap. 

I know that $73 signals that it is a VDI call, and $C8 is for AES calls,
so what does $c9 signify?

This will read a single byte from the midi port, only if theres something
to read:

IF INP?(3)
  value&=INP(3)
ELSE
  value&=-1
ENDIF

The reason for using value& (word) instead of value| (byte) is, if there's
nothing returned, then value& will be -1, whereas if something is available
it will be in the range 0 to 255.

If I understand you correctly...
The gfa MENU(x) values are not advised when the true EVNT_MULTI is 
used. The solution is to link addr_buffer% to the MENU(x) table, so 
don't use MENU(x) but your own table such as :

FUNCTION ev_multi(em_flags&,em_cl&,em_ma&,em_st&,em_ct%,VAR em_mx&,em_my&,em_mk&,em_kbd%,em_key%,em_click&)
  '
  INT{ADD(GCONTRL,2)}=16
  INT{ADD(GCONTRL,4)}=7
  INT{ADD(GCONTRL,6)}=1
  INT{ADD(GCONTRL,8)}=0
  '
  INT{GINTIN}=em_flags&
  INT{ADD(GINTIN,2)}=em_cl&
  INT{ADD(GINTIN,4)}=em_ma&
  INT{ADD(GINTIN,6)}=em_st&
  FOR i&=8 TO 24 STEP 4
    LONG{ADD(GINTIN,i&)}=0
  NEXT i&
  INT{ADD(GINTIN,28)}=WORD(em_ct%)
  INT{ADD(GINTIN,30)}=WORD(SWAP(em_ct%))
  '
  LONG{ADDRIN}=addr_table%
  '
  GEMSYS 25
  '
  em_mx&=INT{ADD(GINTOUT,2)}
  em_my&=INT{ADD(GINTOUT,4)}
  em_mk&=INT{ADD(GINTOUT,6)}
  em_kbd%=INT{ADD(GINTOUT,8)}
  em_key%=INT{ADD(GINTOUT,10)}
  em_click&=INT{ADD(GINTOUT,12)}
  '
  FOR i&=0 TO 7
    menu&(SUCC(i&))=INT{ADD(addr_buffer%,SHL&(i&,1))}  ! solution
  NEXT i&
  '
  RETURN GINTOUT(0)
ENDFUNC

The simpliest way is to look in INT{attr_buffer%+x*2}

AV_SERVER messages are like AES messages coz they use the same GEM pipe. 
                                                          ^^^^ 

The difference is that AV_SERVER message codes which are higher 
(MENU(1) is over 100). See german TOS.HYP (cool developper 
documentation for the codes).
  
Did I answer your question ?

Hi Katherine,

i'm not sure to understand very well your problem, But it seems that you want to use
evnt_multi()
to get a specific messages from "avserver" and the standards system messages ???

In this case, there are no problems. You do a standard evnt_multi() call like
follow:

Message    =    evnt_multi(...)

and when a message OR any other event will occur, evnt_multi will return  these
informations into Message.

to know if it is a message AND what is it you need to do:

if( Message & MU_MESAG)
    /*    This a message, standard or from another application. So you need to check
what there are
    into the Array message[1..8] , passed in parameters of evnt_multi   */

    if( message[0] = <a message code>)
        /* to what it must do ! */



else if( Message & MU_TIMER)
    /*    For example the GEM timer,  (time elapsed) */


check your mail, i will send to you a source example i written...  ;-))

Thanks to all of you :)
I finally managed to get it to work.
The prob was:
That if I put the addr buffer as argument in my evnt_multi() I
couldn't see the regular aes messages (redraw etc), Because I was
still using MENU() >>> not good ;)

So now it is fine:
evnt_multi(,,,,,varptr(msg&(0)),,,,,)

If event& and mu_mesag
select msg&(0)
case wm_topped
etc
This sheme works :)
Thanks!

I suppose, if I use Fxattr(0,filename,&xattr) instead, I get this 
value in xattr.attr as well?

The reason I ask this is, that under MiNT and MagiC, when Pdomain() 
will be naturally set to 1, you might have a non-vfat partition, and 
then Dcreate() and Dopen() don't work. I suppose this isn't hard to 
remedy, since I can test for vfat before these calls, set Pdomain(0), 
and again Pdomain(1) when I'm finished. Is that correct?

I suppose the same goes for Fcreate() and Fopen(). But now another 
problem occurs with existing compilers and their standard libs. I have 
PureC and use only fopen(). If, under single TOS, I try to open a file 
with long name, e.g. X:\longnames\dontknowif\ilikethem.period, then 
fopen() will find and/or open a file X:\longname\dontknow\ilikethe.per 
Under MagiC or MiNT, however, fopen() will fail on a non-vfat 
partition and errno says "Path not found" (this is PureC's fopen()). 
Do I have to write my own fopen() now, or is there another way around 
this problem?

Whoops. I guess I wasn't thinking things through - I could manipulate the

Fxattr() yields non-0 if it can't access the file or directory, so on 
second thought it's not a good idea to use that as a test of the 
drive/partition.

Is there a good and secure way to test if a drive/partition is vfat or 
not?

You doesn't need this information. Also, there are other filesystem
available (MinixFS, RAM-FS).

I doesn't see any problem if you use Dopendir/Dreaddir/Dclosedir and the
new calls that support long and casesensitive/casepreserving filenames.

No. The VFAT entries are not visible for you. Only if you access the
device direct.
Also, the FAT entries are also not visible.
And, there are other filesystems available with a completly different
structure.
Your program doesn't need any information about the phyisical structure
of the filesystem.

Hi,

I'm looking for the Atari version of GNU C++ v2.8.1, which I have been
(reliably) informed is now available. Does anyone know where I can find it?
I am currently using v2.7.3 which works very well - but it would be nice to
have the latest one.

I remember going through this nightmare about a year ago, when I
was trying to link GENST generated assembler with GCC object
files.

The closest I got was finding sourcecode for a freeware linker, but
I can't remember the name. The source for the GCC linker is also
easily available, but it doesn't support DRI or GST formats. You must
convert these to the GCC linkable format using another tool. :/

Sorry I can't help more than this. But the linkable file formats have
always been a bit of a problem on Atari - documenation wise and
availability wise.

Or - as already mentioned - if you use Fsfirst()/next() with certain
versions of SingleTOS and certain search attributes. That's why there's
HideVFAT for SingleTOS, which I'll upload in a few minutes to
ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de

Oh, I forgot: You'll also need HideVFAT with MiNT prior to 1.15 (which
is still in alpha state), because Dopendir() & Co. internally also use
the Fsfirst()/next() of the underlying TOS on FAT partitions, and
therefore 'find' the additional VFAT entries. This may be dependent on
the TOS you're using, but it is true for TOS 4.04 at least.

Maybe Andreas could patch Magic for it to act as single Tos does ?

I've been tracing a bit in the AES lately (working on XaAES (yes, a new
(much more stable and better working) version has been released (source
only for the actual beta7+ so far) and can be found on my ftp site (join
the XaAES mailing list if you are interested in this)) and as far as I
could see, the ¤C9 seems to be used as a kind of AES equivalent of Syield().
That is, it won't do any work but will cause a 'task' switch if possible.

This was never documented, AFAIK, but it has also been used to test for
the presence of an AES, which is why you'll find it in for example the
XaAES trap code.

256 colour rgb tables
Is there a fool proof way of getting these correct. I wrote a
programette a while ago that converted Mac icons into Atari icons in
a resource file? An American user has just mailed me

> I use MagiCMac and also have an Atari TT030.  I use Icon-verter

On my LC475 with MacMagic and Ease they look fine using the RGB table
that Interface generates when it saves colour icons in RSH long
format as the Atari RGB table.

If I try to build a table using vq_colour() values it is terrible.

At present I just use a secondary program to compare the Atari RGB
table with the Mac 'clut' resource and generate a Mac resource source
file that contains a table where the index is the Mac Colour and the
data is the corresponding Atari colour. (Mac 'clut' RGB table is
expressed in values of 0-65535 while the Atari is in 0-1000).

Any ideas.

But there obviously are problems. Under MagiC and MiNT, Pdomain() is 
set to 1. But in that case, Dcreate(path) will fail if `path' is, or 
contains, a name > 8 chars. But I don't want it to fail. I want it to 
work as under plain TOS, i.e. with names truncated to 8 chars. The 
same goes for Dopendir(), etc. So if I know I have a vfat drive or 
partition, I can bracket those calles with Pdomain(0) and Pdomain(1) 
calls.

Anyone interested in writing TWAIN scanner support for TOS based systems
(preferably through the use of Parx's M&E System Folder) can do so by
downloading specification 1.7 from the TWAIN Working Group's webpage.  This
way, we can finally get to use those inexpensive Visioneer PaperPort scanners
on our lowly Atari computers!  I'd love to hook up the Mac version to my
Falcon's LAN port.

Russ,

The DRI .o format used on the Atari ST is the same as that used on
CP/M 68K. If you go to the Unofficial CP/M Web page at

http://cdl.uta.edu/cpm

or the mirror at

http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cfs/cpm

you can download the CP/M 68K Programmers Reference Guide which
details this.

DRI defined several output formats for the executable, the main
ones being 

CP/M 68K contigious format relocatable and absolute, magic number 601A 
GEMDOS contigious format relocatable, magic number 601A 
CP/M 68K noncontigious format relocatable and absolute, magic number 601B 
CDOS 68K crunched relocatable, magic number 601C 

The CP/M 601A relocatable format uses one word of relocation information
for each word of code and data in the program and so produces a file which
is very big. The GEMDOS 601A uses a more compact relocation information
the following is a description of the GEMDOS 601A format from the GEMDOS
manual in the ICATARI user group magazine issue 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An executable file consists of  a  header  followed  by

images  for  the text and data segments, zero or more symbol
table entries, a  fixup  offset,  and  zero  or  more  fixup
records:
        
           Executable File Parts

            ___________________
           |    file header   |
           |__________________|
           |                  |
           |   text segment   |
           |                  |
           |__________________|
           |   data segment   |
           |__________________|
           |      symbols     |
           |                  |
           |__________________|
           | fixup information|
           |__________________|

        
The file header contains a "magic" number (a  signature
to indicate that it is an executable file) and several long-
words containing size information:

           Executable File Header
        
             _________________________________________
            |Offset |Size  |Description              |
            ------------------------------------------
            | 0x00  |  word|  0x601A (magic number)  |
            | 0x02  |  long|  Size of text segment   |
            | 0x06  |  long|  Size of data segment   |
            | 0x0A  |  long|  Size of BSS segment    |
            | 0x0E  |  long|  Size of symbol table   |
            | 0x12  |  long|  (reserved)             |
            | 0x16  |  long|  (reserved)             |
            | 0x1A  |  long|  (reserved)             |
            | 0x1E  |      |  (start of text segment)|
            |_______|______|_________________________|
        
        
The text and data segment images immediately follow the
header.  The symbol table, if there is one, follows the data
segment.
        
GEMDOS will "fix up" a longword in  the  text  or  data
segments by adding the base of the text segment to the value
already in the longword.  The  fixup  list  specifies  which
longwords need to be relocated.  The first item in the fixup
list is a longword specifying the offset of the first fixup;
        
the  longword  is  NULL (0L) if there are no fixups.  Single
bytes following the longword specify offsets to more fixups.
The  longwords  _.m_.u_.s_.t start on word boundaries, or the system
will crash.
        
         Relocation Bytes
        
          _______________________________________________________
         |Byte         |Description                             |
         --------------------------------------------------------
         | 0           |  end of relocation information         |
         | 1           |  advance 254 bytes, get next byte      |
         | 2, 4, .. 254|  fixup longword at location pointer    |
         | 3, 5, .. 255|  (odd numbers, reserved for future use)|
         |_____________|________________________________________|
        
        
Symbol Table

The symbol table consists of symbol-table entries, for-
matted as:
        
        Symbol Table Entry

        ___________________
       |                  |

        |_______________________|________|
        
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sozobon system extends the symbol table types as described in the
documents thet come with it.

The Sozobon linker outputs the GEMDOS format executables only and does
not understand 16 bit relocation information or PC relative fixups, it
assumes all address references are 32 bit. This is ok for the output from
the Sozobon compiler but is not so good for handeling hand coded assembly
files.

I am currently (very sloooowly) working on a modified version of the
Sozobon
tools to allow me to use them as a cross development platform for the PC to
let me build a working CP/M 68K system when I eventually get some hardware
to run it on.

I currently have the linker modified to handle GEMDOS and CP/M 68K 601A
format output files, to handle 16 bit address references, PC relative
fixups
and to fix one or 2 bugs in the linker.

I plan to add support for 601B and 601C format files and absolute files
next.
After that I plan to look at JAS and expand that a bit.

If you want the new linker or need any more info on the DRI 68K file
formats
drop me an email to:  peter at cylon dot ie.

Regards,
Peter Mc Shane

	Hi, all. I'm trying to write my own rsrc_load() function. This routine is 
nearly done, except from one thing, which is what I'm asking for help about 
now. Right now I'm doing the 4 plane forms (color icons) to 16 plane froms. 
And this is where I need some help.

 My problems are those; When I, after converted the icon data from 4 to 16 
plane device indipendant format, use vr_trnmf() to transform this into device 
indipendant format, it works as it should on the Falcon (Videl, standard 16-
bit motorola format, rrrrrggg,gggbbbbb). But, vr_trnmf() don't seem to work 
with my Crazy Dots 15-bit gfx card (which is 16-plane intel format, 
gggbbbbb,0rrrrrggg, where bit 0 is not used). Does this mean that vr_trnfm() 
don't work correctly with byte-swapped gfx modes, like the Crazy Dots?

 I then did the transformation to device dependant myself, and this worked 
exactly as it should, so I KNOW that this problem is within the vr_trnsfm() 
funtion. I've been trying to read some C sources to see how they do it, and it 
seems to me that they are actually doing the device independant -> device 
dependant transformation manually, after checking what the device dependant 
format looks like. Now, that leads us to my question..

 How do I check in a reliable way what format (byte swappted or standard 
motorola, 15 or 16 bit) I should use?? Any help on this matter is most 
appreciated.

I am still working on my "Toolbox" DLL engine. (started mid-1992)

It was written in 68k assembly language.

It uses 32k of RAM, runs on TOS 1.0 STs through TTs. (Falcons? Hades?)

A 68000-family CPU is required.

Libraries can be bootloaded, or loaded as needed by applications.

It supports System and User libraries.

There is support for library enumeration and interrogation.

Each library can be used by more than one application.

It can be called from the foreground application via a TRAP. Or, if you 
_must_ it can be called via a jumptable.


(Ideally, it would have been ready for public release this week, or early 
next week)

Still to do: user and programmer manuals.

Me (Rodolphe Pineau) and a friend (Eric Gaudet) are working on the
adaptation of a paralelle pocket ethernet adaptator from PC World to the
Falcon. For the momment, we could read and write adaptator's registers
and read the EEProm to get the hardware adresse.
We hope to code the readpacket and write packet routine next week the
release a beta of the MiNT Net driver.

Salut rodolphe.

Me and some friends (the CloeTeam) are working on the Version two of our 3d
modeler/renderer :Cloe2.
For the instant we are only working on the pc version but i want to make the
Atari version like the first version of CLOE.

But we need hands. This version of Cloe will be much much powerful than the
first version and it will be freeware, but we don't have the time to make
the Atari conversion. It's not so much work because it's only minor
modification on our windows system. The code of Cloe is OS independant for
the user interface. There is a little work to do for the plugin system.
Note i think that for compatibility between vdi we need to use Nvdi because
we use much more off-screen than the first version. In the first version
this part of code was write in ASM but whith the new graphics mode for the
Hades and the other Atari clone ot was not good. So i want pure gem/nvdi coe
now.

Waiting for hands.

Cool! What kind of ethernet-adapter do you adapt? Hopefully it's
something that's easier to find than the DE600 ;-) It looks like I'm
going to get a Milan this year, so a ethernet-solution for my Falcon
is something I really need.

Hi !!

I am looking for the object file formats for the different compilers on
the ATARI computers.
In particular, I am interested in the formats of
 PureC, PurePascal - containing the debugging info stored in the object
                     file. Is there any Profiling info stored in the
                     object file, so that PureProfiler can work with ??
 MegaMaxModula 2   - for the definition modules and the implementation
                     modules, also containing debug info, if applicable.
 GNU C/C++/ObjC    - Also need "full details" about the object files.

 
Any other object file formats are also greatly appreciated. 
I am currently writing kind of a ReAssembler, so I need to know anything
that is available about all the object file formats available on the
ATARIs. Is the *.LOD file's format for the Falcon DSP modules anywhere
documented, or do I have to ReAssemble the Falcon ROMs to get the info I
need about ?

We're using all ethernet adapter based on th RTL8012 from Realtek. Most of
actual adapter are based on this chip (exept the DE620 and the Xircom
ones).After this one we shurely have a look to the DE620 from DLink witch
replace the DE600. We ask Dlink for documentation but they don't aswer :-((
We'll use Linux source code for the DE620 (wheras we've got data sheet for the
RTL8012 and Linux sources :-)) )

You open the database file.
Click on Query.
You can then either search for free text or you can use the Expression
to fill in a dialogue box with a complex expression for the search
criteria. This is of the form:

<Field Name> <operator> <Expression>

where <Fieldname> is selected from the displayed list
<operator> (= , >, < etc)
<Expression> is built from the list of functions in the scroll box.

Expressions tend to look like expressions in Basic.

PLEASE REPLY IMMEDIATLY!! Because we have to arrange a vacation and have to
travel for 2 days to get there.....

How would I do that? what is the way of doing for:

pexec a ttp with arguments given to it, and DO NOT display any output
produced by it.
Thanks.
I heard I might have to Fforce()? duplicate?
