This Version is the So called
Babel Ala Faltrion    :) (refered to as 'Babel' in this text)

Anyway...

This is what you should have in the final version.
the things that are marked with an * are what exist in the current Babel

Misc:
* Run as TOS or GEM program
* In GEM it can be made into a "silent" mode where it will require NO
      useraction (IE no alert-boxes)
  Be able to use either MSG-ID or article numbers.
* All Key-combinations is now send to the AV-Sever if running in multitasking,
  this makes it almost like a part of the desktop, ie if you are running Thing
  pressing ALT-C will bring up the contents of the C-partition, etc...
  
When Online Babel should...
* Retrieve new News articles.
* Retrieve requested newsarticles
* Send news articles.
  Get new groups of a server
  Get descriptions of new groups.
* Connect to an new server and get all groups/descriptions.

In maintenance mode (start babel with the commandline of "-m" or "--maintenance"
  Convert OLD header formats into new headerformat
       (this is if the headerformat changes.)
* Making the comment tree. (slow version)
* Deleting OLD messages
* Deleting messages that are marked Deleted
  Delete duplicate messages.
  Sort Group list
  Sort Description list
  Delete duplicate entries in group list
  Delete duplicate entries in the descripton list.
  Add descriptions to groups in the active file that has no
      descriptions (only if an description exist)
  Create an new headerfile if the old one is broken or does 
      not exist NOTE: this part can be done withe the recover.ttp that is in the
      news-directory, drop any *.inm file on it and it will recreate the *.inh file
      (note all the flags will be gone....)
