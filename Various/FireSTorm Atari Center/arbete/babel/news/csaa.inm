In 1988/89 I was running X11R3 on a 4MB Sun 3/50 (68020 based UNIX
workstation) and other Sun 3 machines.  There is no problem running X
in 4MB.  Of course I don't know how big a footprint MiNT has (my Mega
4ST has been in storage for a few years).

To this day, I have trouble thinking of the phrase "go to" as consisting

Hi-

I have some Atari Hardware/Software I need to dispose of.  Here is a
partial list.  Please respond with email since I don’t read these news
groups.

32 bit stuff
Atari Falcon 030 (4mb) (HD Drive)

16 bit stuff
Atari 1040 ST  (4mb) (DD drive)
Atari SC1224 Monitor
Atari SLM 804 Laser Printer
Atari SC1224 Color Monitor
Atari SF254 SD Disk Drive
ICD SCSI Controller Card
Practical Solutions Mouse Master (Joystick / Mouse Switch)
2 Alfa Data Mice for Atari / Amiga  (Very good mouse)
Home made box to allow use of VGA monitor with an Atari computer.  Has
high/low resolution switch

8 bit stuff
Atari 65XE (Computer)
Atari 1010 Tape Drive
Rana Systems 1000 Double Density Disk Drive
2 Atari 1050 Disk Drives (1.5 Density)
1 Atari 1050 Disk Drive - Not Working - Parts Only 
ICD PR: Connection (Parallel and Two Serial Ports)
Atari Xmm 801 printer
Nec Composite monitor.  About 13 inches.  Green Display.

I simply don’t have room for this old computer stuff, so I need to get
rid of it.  All offers will be considered, but trades for PC hardware
will be given first priority.  I have a lot of software, books and
cables that I have not cataloged yet, if you want something in
particular I will let you know if I have it.  I live in Columbus Ohio,
USA.  
 
Thank you
John Wagner

Why

AFAIK Alpha processors are manufactured by Digital which is now owned by
Compaq and they're the one who own the technology. Judging from your
conversation Intel have bought or licenced Alpha technology, is this true?
If that's the case, where can I find more information about this since I
have obviously missed something.

But this copy part is ridiculous, Intel needs the latest in technology just
because of their efforts to keep the old structure and concept they used in
the Intel x86 processors. A concept dating back more than Intel CPU's and
that was great ... back in the 80's in the first Z80 home computers. Today
Alpha and PowerPC processors are way ahead if you compare the ratio between
technology used and performance given. Intel has often used better
technology if you look at plain electronics involved. Still they get
outperformed by relatively simple and cheap RISC processors.

Oops.  My XEGS was bought to replace a dead 130XE (never let a
"former" Atari repair person try and add an 80 column chip to your
computer), and has been in storage for a few years.  Time to drag it
out and refresh my memory.

    nope -  call the  cops and  have  them charged.  After all,  it's  a
federal offence in Canada to sell pirated software, with fines of up  to
$1,000,000 and  jail  time of  up  to 10  years  for the  miscreants  if
convicted.

    Besides, an  SLM804  laser printer  makes  a more  satisfying  blunt
object to inflict pain :)

    I note that not only are you still not using a proper newsreader  on
your "superior" Mac, you've also stopped printing that drivel about  how
the iMac will make PC  users switch to Mac by  the CompUSA exec in  your
replies. Perhaps the news about CompUSA's financial woes have finally 
made you start to face reality about the Mac's fate if Apple don't stop 
putting their eggs in one basket and screwing their faithful 
independant dealers........

I would think that the Alphas only did the rendering, so it shouldn't be to hard to
port a
renderer to it. The editing probably took place one something else.

I recently aquired an Atari ST520 system is barely used.  I received
it in a trade and thought I could use it, but really can't.

Here is what I have got:

Atari 520ST
Atari Megafile 60 hard drive expansion unit
Atari SC1224 color monitor
Atari SM124 black and white monitor
Atari SMM804 printer

I have all cables and such to connect this all together.
Currently the Megafile 60 and the SM124 monitor are labeled
for 220v European power, but for all I know it is an easy 
conversion to get it to run on 120v.  If not, transformers
are available to make these run on 110 power.  I have some
but they will cost extra to ship with this.

I have absolutely no idea what this stuff is worth if anything,
but I am willing to accept offers or trades for PC and
Amiga stuff.

Everything is in perfect near new condition.  I am in the 
military in Europe, so I can ship to a U.S. or European address.

According to reports (years ago) in this forum you can have X with an

sized in the range 2.5 - 3.5 megabyte. I'd guess that the one for ST is
about the same size.

Not true.

Compaq and Digital has merged and they have only signed a deal with Intel
to let Intel manufacture the Alpha processor. Intel doesn't own anything,
they will just produce the chip which will let them double the performance
until year 2000 with Intels tehnology (0.18 micron).

Its been a while since I last posted here.  As a result the number of posts
have declined..  It's time for sinclap to be controversial again to raise
that blood pressure.

Now that Cubase VST has been avialble for the PowerMac line for some time. Why
would new Cubase users and Atari legacy ST folks would upgrade to a Hades,
shades or what ever instead of a PowerMac or wintel based cubase solution?

The Mac/wintel platforms are more powerful for less money.  That concept has
been lost on the Atari boobs(since I own Atari game machines, does that make
me an Atari boob?)

Just curious..

    as usual, TIFKAS puffs himself up and tries to make himself more 
important tahn he actually is - in reality, he's nothing more than a 
zit on the face of the computing world. Posts have actually been pretty 
good the last few weeks despite his "help"....but at least TIFKAS 
admits that his main efforts are as a "troll".

    why? simple - cost. At over $3000  CDN, a complete G3 is simply  too
expensive - AND it doesn't have built-in MIDI ports (which are  STANDARD
on the Hades) - and then you have to add the software! Even though  MIDI
ports are optional on  the now-released Milan  (which TIFKAS chooses  to
conveniently ignore),  with that  option it's  still MUCH  cheaper  than
buying the G3. The much-hyped iMac would have been the PERFECT  platform
to run Cubase VST on, but thanks  to the idiots at Apple wanting to  put
non-standard ports on it, it becomes an instant closed architecture boat
anchor. Windblows  platforms are  notorious for  having timing  problems
regarding MIDI that make them a problem than a solution for the  serious
musician - and shame  on you for  even expecting us  to consider a  Bi66
6ates "solution". As  usual, TIFKAS  has his foot  in his  mouth (when  he
doesn't have his head stuck up another orifice).

    "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". That's the credo of many music 
makers who still find use out of their Ataris now and for years to 
come. A better concept than to endlessly throw money at the green-eyed 
monster called "techno-lust"

    more the concepts of "the truth" and "fair play" have been lost on 
TIFKAS. Your "boobhood" has certainly been well-ascertained over the 
last five years - note that he STILL can't set up a proper newsreader 
on his Mac despite his rants that the Mac is the SUPERIOR Internet 
platform, unlike me, who have set up my "inferior" copy of NEWSie in 
minutes. And as a Mac-owner, I think I can speak more of the Mac 
platform more truthfully than this misanthropic blowhard, who I suspect 
is really posting to the net on a Commodore 64 in his mom's basement  
apartment with 12 30-foot piles of MacUser magazine which he skips 
through naked merrily at night (not that there's anything wrong with 
that).... :)

Good points.  I've been an Atari user for quite some time.  In the early
eighties, I had several 8-bits, then I bought an STE back in 1990, when
Atari was still a company and the Falcon hadn't been introduced yet, and I
used that STE with (regular) Cubase for a couple of years.  Then I started
thinking about switching to a PC or MAC, but I decided to upgrade to a
Falcon around 1994 because I got an amazing deal on one from a large music
store chain called Guitar Center.  They were phasing out their Atari
support, and the sales guy didn't seem to know much about the Falcon.
That was around the time new Falcons (4 megs / 80 meg HD) were going for
around $1300.  I go it for less than half that (new in the box with all
the software).

Anyway, I've been using it with Cubase Audio now for a couple of years,
and with the 16meg memory upgrade, and 4.29 gig Seagate Barracuda drive,
it works pretty well.  But seeing my roomate's new (and cheap) PC running
Cubase VST (as well as the extremely cool Rebirth TB 303, TR 808
emulator), I must say switching over is looking very good again.  I'm
toying with the idea of getting a NEMESIS accellerator board for my
Falcon, but I can't help but wonder if my money would be better spent on a
new PC or MAC?

Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy the Atari, and can do pretty much everything
I need to do with it (Internet, DTP, music, etc.) but that's beginning to
change - at least with regard to music software.  Of course I have heard
many stories of timing problems running any incarnation of Cubase on a PC,
and the G3s are still quite pricy - but I'm pretty sure I'd want one over
a PC (for music especially).  And of course I don't care to add to Mr.
Gate's bottom line either - which is impossible _not_ to do with the PC
route.  So, for now, I'm sticking with the Falcon, but in the near
future, who knows...

	Why not see what can be done with a Linux box?
	It would likely end up being considerably cheaper

You're no more controversial, but just as annoying, as a mosquito.

Hmmmm, make a decision like that based upon one application huh?  Do 
you do that?  If they want to move over it's their decision.

Powerful?  Maybe.  A bus is, after all, more powerful than a 
motorcycle.  And you have that nice little man sitting in the front, 
telling you where you want to go today, just like the nice little 
people in Redmond and Cupertino.

Boob I may be, but I'll stick with my Atari.  It's not so much the 
'Presence of Light' as the 'Absence of Dark'.

<nod> I see.  I always understood curiousity to mean something

information endlessly and indiscriminately foisted upon those who dare

I'm not sure that I understand this one. From what I've read, the iMac has the
following ports:

(2) USB
RJ-45 (for 100Base-T ethernet)
(2) RS-232 (for phone and modem)

All of these ports are very standard. I would be more worried about the lack
of built-in MIDI.

    well. maybe I did go a bit overboard there :) I HAVE seen USB 
working (went to a pre-launch demo of Windows '98 with my boss) and was 
most impressed - and I'm glad to hear regarding MacWorld that there are 
some more USB stuff coming with Mac drivers (though I suspect that the 
USB market is coming in more with the launch of Windows '98 and that 
Apple is riding their coat-tails). See, unlike TIFKAS, I DO check out 
stuff before I open my big yap, and I DO admit when I'm wrong - unlike 
TIFKAS, who responds with insults and bragging about his monetary 
assets and his "abilities" as a "macho stud" in order to mask the fact he 
has the IQ of a burrito. :)

    Still, for a musician, the ability to have a configurable system is 
paramount. In the case of the iMac, the way it's designed precludes any 
attempt to modify it to use it as a hard-disk recording station, much  
less any upgrades you need to do (what if you need to upgrade the RAM? 
Is it any wonder Apple buckled under and finally made a 56K modem 
standard rather than the 33.6 they were originally going to foist on 
their customers?). And in the case of hard-disk recording with a 
computer, SCSI is the standard for its proven track record of speed and 
reliability; USB is an unknown quality for the moment whether it can 
handle this. I'll have to ask Club Cubase if there's any plans to 
support USB in later versions of Cubase VST.

    one thing is still certain that we can agree on though, TIFKAS is 
still a loser troll who's forgotten his original primary goal of 
defending the Mac (a platform that for the most part can defend itself) 
in order to try to get the last word - and has made himself a 
laughingstock to all computer users in the process. :)

	Until better support for USB actually comes on line, yes
	it can be considered a non-standard port.

	If it doesn't quite suit the task (timing), those

Do you mean support in the OS sense or in the sense that few vendors have
products for it? I would disagree with the first because the Mac OS simply
treates USB like ADB and Windows 98 has explicit support for USB. I would
disagree with the second because there are quite a few peripherals that you
can get for USB right now. And if you can't get a peripheral that you need
for USB, you can always spend $50 on a USB->SCSI adaptor.

If you need tons of RAM (though the iMac will allow you to go to something
like 256MB, I believe), a really fast HD system and lots of upgradability
then you are well outside the market that target market of the iMac. You are
also looking for a solution that Atari cannot provide.

USB is cheaper, allows you to add and remove devices while your system is
running, allows more devices and doesn't require the user to select IDs. OTOH,
it's slower. In any case, USB is not meant to replace SCSI. It's meant to
replace parallel, serial, joystick, keyboard and mouse ports.

This is a little long, sorry, but I just had some random thoughts 
regarding price and power.

Just a little background: I work for an international paper products 
company, and my particular mill employs approximately 1,300 people. In 
my capacity as a 'spare' I have occasion to work in many of the 
departments throughout the mill.

This week, I am working in materials (or purchasing).  Of the 
fifty-nine purchase orders that I sent out, seven were ordering 
personal computers (6 PC, 1 Mac).  I know, from working in (among 
other areas) Information Tech., Accounts Payable, and Purchasing 
that my company is averaging about 25 personal computers a month.  
Anyway, as I was entering the purchase orders for these computers I 
started thinking about TIFKAS' assertation that 'Atari Boobs' refuse 
to accept the fact that a Mac or Wintel platform is cheaper and more 
powerful than an Atari.

Here is a rough idea of what was spent on these computers, and just a 
minimum of software - mostly Office '97, and some licensing fees.. 
Three of the packages were over $8,000.00.; three were a little more 
than $6,700.00, and one was just a little over $5,800.00 (and no, it 
wasn't the Mac).  This is just for the basics: drives, modems, 
monitors - no printers or anything.  Now, I understand that 
corporations are more likely to spend money on features that they 
don't really need and that that accounts for part of the price, but 
we're not talking supercomputers here... mostly just 233 mHz Pentiums.

OK, now.. the company buys these systems, let's say at an average 
price of around seven thousand dollars.  What happens with them?   How 
are they actually used? (And remember, I actually work in all of these 
departments, so I see it firsthand)
  1- As a terminal to network to our company's AS 400 Business System
     (just recently upgraded from a System/36), running software that 
     for the most part was written in 1984. This is where the real 
     work is done, not on the fancy PCs.
  2- Trying to use Excel as a spreadsheet, desktop publishing program, 
     forms generator, data base and lord only knows what else.
       a- Word? Hah.  Most never touch it, and aside from occasionally 
          changing fonts, some basic tables, and the laser printed 
          output, they don't do anything I wasn't doing with Letter 
          Perfect on my 400 way back in 1980.
       b- Access? PowerPoint? (and so on) - 19 out of 20 wouldn't even 
          be able to tell you how to load & run it, much less what it 
          was for.
  3- Playing Solitaire, pinball, minesweeper, checking email, and 
     printing photos/graphics that they downloaded from the internet.
  Naturally, there are some exceptions to this, and some groups 
actually get some good use out of some sophisticated applications, but 
it is either on a turnkey computer, meant to manage process control or 
things of that nature - the engineers doing their blueprints, and the 
IT people themselves - but that amounts to less than about 2% of the 
computers in use at my mill.

  A day doesn't go by that I'm not called by coworkers 5 to 12 times 
to help them figure out how to use a program, recover from a crash, or 
explain how to set up their computer at home.  I have no idea why they 
would call me, instead of Info Tech.... after all, I'm just an 'Atari 
Boob.'

  I'm constantly amazed at the number of simple (or complex) things 
that I can't get accomplished on these $7000 systems that would take 
me a matter of seconds on my Atari.  Why should I have to be told that 
there is no .dll to import a JPEG into a report I'm generating?  Be 
told that I can't use the 16-bit version of Acrobat Reader with this 
32-bit Operating System?  Not be able to access files because some of 
the desks are using Windows 3.1, some '95, some '97, and some NT? Now, 
granted, this is all a function of the available (or installed) 
software, but if the company is spending $7,000 then I sure as **** 
should be able to do something that I am able to do at home with 
shareware or freeware programs. Sure, go out and buy the software you 
need.  Add it right on top of the $7000 you've already spent.

  And don't even talk to me about crashes and munged applications...  Or 
cooperative multitasking... or network failures... or or or ad 
infinitum.
  
  I've a coworker that bought himself a nice Aptiva back in April.  He 
did get a pretty good deal on the computer itself... But now, months 
later, after purchasing a monitor, printer, scanner, photo printer, 
digital camera, and gobs of software that he himself admits that he'll 
probably never use, he is up to a total investment approaching 
_ten_thousand_dollars_ .... so, let's not blithely talk about how 
cheap PCs and Macs are, alright?

A couple of corrections:
That's 59 purchase orders today, not this week :)
and
In the "Constantly amazed" paragraph, I meant Office '97, not to imply 
that there was any such beast as "Windows '97"

Just listen to yourself..All your posts directed to me have a insulted and

shape.

A computer is a computer, a tool...Nothing more.. Not a religious jihad...

I suppose when I get my imac later in the year, it's cable modem 'baby'.. 
Since the cable modem will be installed in my super fast standard 100mb
ethernet port, should have i paid for this unecessary modem which I will not
use?

Also I will have to pay a $150 installation fee regardless that I have a built
in ethernet connection.  The fee is the ethernet card for the wintels..

Non standard ports?  USB is industry standard.. You need to rethink before
your foot is stuck you know were..

When I am in Calif next week, I will ask the folks(idiots according to you)why
they went strictly with USB on the imac.

Depends on the cost of the board.  Most likely that the price for the Falcon
card could yield you a spanking new Umax Powermac clone with at least a 240
mhz processor for $599.  Price includes 32m and 3G's..

But you maybe missing out...Now that PowerMacs and wintels are super cheap you
can use the power of the browsers - IE and Communicator to get full use of the

   well, hello sports fans (but espescially The Idiot Forever Known As
Sinclap)...

   I took the plunge for work and bought myself a nice used Mac PowerBook
140 for use as a PDA unit. And so far, I'm quite pleased with it.

   And, as you can see, I'm posting this using Newsreader, the wonderful
USENET newsreader program for the Macintosh. Which mens that if someone
like me can get on the USENET in minutes on a Mac with just a small amount
of configuration, then someone like SinClap, who has ranted long and loud
about how his Mac is more capable of being an internet machine than us
poor "Atari boobs" should be more than capable of taking the plunge and
not having to use the crutch of DejaNews to post his MCIBTYC drivel.

   the writing's on the wall, TIFKAS, PUT UP OR SHUT UP.

   BTW, no need to worry folks - I'm still in the Atari camp, for as soon
as I get this puppy a bigger drive and more RAM it's gonna become the most
perfect Atari laptop you'll ever see via MagiCMac :)

I have to say that I agree and disagree.  The situation you describe is
common enough and I see much of the same thing myself.  Lots of
money spent on hardware and software that isn't understood, isn't
used or doesn't work.

However, it's perfectly possible for a consumer to educate themselves
and put together a decent system that does work and doesn't cost
both arms and a leg.  Notice I said possible, not common.

Still there's something to be said about the lure of using the ST and
even older systems.  These were machines, as were the machines before them,
that you could really understand and that you could actually make do the
things
that you wanted to with a reasonable investment of time and money.

    oh, that's nice TIFKAS. However, the cost of the Nemesis is $100 
US, or $159 CDN - and I know that because I have one in my Falcon, 
which I bought from Titan Designs on one of my trips to the UK.

    Care to share with me your source for a $100 US Umax clone? 'Cause

You need drivers for each of the devices that you attach unless they will work
with some sort of generic drivers. Windows 98 provides those drivers for
keyboards and mice but you need software from the vendor to support their
particular scanners, printers, etc. (though drivers for some of these devices
ship with Windows 98 and are hot loaded when they are needed). I haven't heard
of any USB device support for FreeBSD.

That's not a very good definition of a standard. I like the Merriam Webster
defintion better:

....
(3) something established by authority, custom, or general consent as a model
or example
....

As you can see, the definition doesn't not guarantee any particular level of
usefulness. There are many standards for computer hardware that have never
been directly useful to me.

The alternatives you suggest all run Multi-tasking OSes (with the exception of the
Mac which sort of pretends) ... Multi OSes and MIDI do not get on.  Time and time
again musicians bare testimony to the rock-solid timing of the humble
single-tasking Atari ST.

VST is pants as is any program of its ilk.  Despite what they would have you
believe music cannot be made within a computer only and a good sound requires an
outboard mixer, effects processor, professional digital mastering format etc etc
not to mention the difficulties of plugging acoustic instruments or high-quality
microphones into the badly insulated poorly performing reality that is a
'sound-card'.  Of all the many home studios AND professional studios I have been
in I see one computer in use more than any other ... an Atari ST :)

A true classic.

Jim.

SCSI requires drivers for it's devices as well. The OS may provide drivers for
generic storage devices and scanners but it can't provide support for every
conceivable device. Just as USB can't.

Very true. All you need is a driver for the interface card and then the vendor
can support their particular device.

Which I already explained: USB allows the hot attachment/removal or devices,
USB allows 127 devices, USB doesn't require the user to set device IDs and USB
has a huge maximum cable length.

	At the rate USB vendors are moving, SCAM just may

How can something cost me less money if I just remain with the system 
I currently have in use? Surely they are not giving PC's and Macs (at 
least not yet) away?

Why no response to the Dept of Navy dropping Apple and going to Win 98 
based machines for servers? Actually another update since that post is 
a directive from the NAVAIR commander that in a couple years, only PC 
based machines will be allowed for offical use on hundreds of 
thousands of government employees desktops.
That really has to put a dent into Apples plans considering their 
declining rate in the market place.

I wholeheartedly agree.  As I said, those were just some random 
thoughts.  I respect the ones that approach the system as a tool, 
because it offers a way of accomplishing something that they need to 
have done.  It is just unfortunate that so many pursue - shall we say 
- "other venues".

My original 400 is still in use daily at a friend's photo lab.  Sure, 
it's almost 20-years-old, but as long as it continues to accomplish 
what he needs done he plans on keeping it.

USB wasn't really viable for most vendors until Microsoft added support for it
in windows. USB is a good standard and I have already explained why.

This upsets me. The Amiga kernel is central to its efficiency and

I'm uncertain, they've stated that they bought Amiga for its

platform.

I'd say it's neither or a little of both.

If the Amiga can, why not the PC? And how do you know this isn't

I welcome all alternatives, but I want to keep the Amiga alive, and
I'm not sure that Gateway are planning to produce an Amiga.

The Fuji logo doesn't necessarily mean it's a good computer. Sure, the

Hello to all,

I've had a 520ST and 1040 ST running since 1986. Just got a 4 meg Falcon.

I'm hoping to find original disks for some of my old programs, particularly 
the old Astrology program that came from the APX or Antic archives.

Any leads for those things? My wife loves the old Astrology program, and I'll 
buy it from someone if I need to.

Thanks,

Craig Morehouse

One of the first big MiNT distributions, the TAF-kit, came with X11 as default
GUI. It works nicely on a 4meg ST. But lemme get this discussion straight,
so far the line was that an Amiga can do anything an Alpha can do in Linux
because an Amiga will run Linux as well, but that this doesn't go for Ataris
because MiNT isn't fully Linux compatible? Are we forgetting that Linux will
run on an Atari as well? (And, again, that X will also work under MiNT).

	It may not necessarily go for MiNT.

	That does not address Atari in general.

	A Falcon will quite happily run Linux and could 
	quite happily contribute to a D2 render farm
	right beside an Ameboa, an Alpha, a Sidewinder
	or any other supported platform...

Your a riot. You post to a newsgroup where people probably haven't

Pretty simple. The Mac O/S and Win 95/8. Why make it hard on yourself 
when you have one of the simplest and most compact O/S's available to 
utilize with one of those powerful clones (opps, clone is not a 
Macster term anymore:).

>
>The Mac/wintel platforms are more powerful for less money.

More powerful, but still slower with the O/S that they must toat 
around. Besides why should a PPC user be afarid of a little old 060? 
Must be fear to cause you to post here. What else could it be? At 
least you'll still have a home here when Apple goes under:).

>  That concept has
>been lost on the Atari boobs(since I own Atari game machines, does that make

Considering only in the last year processors have been able to manage 
the giant O/S's Apple and WinTel machines use, I think that Atari

Your a riot. You post to a newsgroup where people probably haven't 
switched computers in four to six years, and you think a couple of

Pretty simple. The Mac O/S and Win 95/8. Why make it hard on yourself 
when you have one of the simplest and most compact O/S's available to 
utilize with one of those powerful clones (opps, clone is not a 
Macster term anymore:).

More powerful, but still slower with the O/S that they must toat 
around. Besides why should a PPC user be afarid of a little old 060? 
Must be fear to cause you to post here. What else could it be? At 
least you'll still have a home here when Apple goes under:).

Considering only in the last year processors have been able to manage

users have done quite well with their selections in the past.

Atari Fans! Finally a Microsoft product you can use.

Guaranteed not to crash! (Although, it burns quite well.)

         Priceless!
         (Slightly higher in Canada)
         
is pleased to announce the immediate availability of fine, handcrafted 
writing paper:

  100% Hand-made
  100% Recycled
  100% Post-Microsoft content

OK, not so fine actually.  I'm just starting this and am learning as I 
go - But it is perfectly useable writing paper, approximately 8.5x11 
inch.  Guaranteed to be 100% repulped Microsoft documentation and MS 
generated printouts.  This is the first in a series of Atari-related 
items that I will be making available.  This is pretty much just to 
raise a small amount of capital to enable me to make Atari-related 
memo pads, blank books (and some with Atari info, I'm in the process 
of negotiating with some people at the moment) and a planned 
Atari-generated, hand-bound (hard cover) Atari-specific book 
(hopefully the first of a series).

Contact me for more information

tross3@hamtel.tds.net

Thanks!

Nothing slow about OS 8.1...Not afraid of the 060...the PPC line is modern and
costs less than 060's.

What "modern" features do Apple PPC motherboards (excuse me, logic

Where did word processors come into the discussion?" Were are talking 
about production 68060 processors currently being manufactured 
by Motorola and used in several desktop systems now around the world, 
and replacing the 68000/040 embeded systems rapidly.

Yea, I like to go to C.S.A.A and watch one with the pet name of 
SinPlop reach around his behind and eat what he spews from his mouth.

You've lost your touch, SinPlop. Why don't you just go purchase one of 
Bill's machines like your shrink says and get it over with. You'll be 
a lot happier.

	Pointcast is a push client that requires a proprietary

In my case an imac would be the perfect upgrade.  Yes it does include
PointCast. However, I was promised a new PowerBook G3 within six months.

Below is a copy of a small letter sent to Dejanews concerning TIFKAS 
recent post to the comp.sys.atari.st newsgroup.

Lets try to keep the mud and blood in the advocacy group where it belongs.

    ahh, trying to compare a Milan with an Atari 800? Two very different
machines -  that's like  saying  "I breathed  on  a Commodore  64  once,
therefore I'm an expert  on Gateway's plans for  the Amiga". Anyone  who
would seriously  try to  compare  an 800  with  a Milan  is  dangerously
idiotic and  should be  kept  away from  any  position in  the  computer
industry (except for sweeping the halls at Intel) Try again, weinerhead.

    so not only did you flunk history, political science and  geography,
you also  got poor  marks in  economics. What  did you  do major  in  in
university, TIFKAS  - "Baiting  Feminists 101"?  The problems  with  the
Canadian currency at the  moment has more to  do with Asian markets.  Or
are you posting from an alternate universe (this explanation makes  more
sense, as everything that  TIFKAS says makes more  sense if prefaced  by
the disclaimer "In Bizarro World.....")?

    As for my own "undesirability", I happen to hold dual citizenship to
both the US and  Canada, and have  gone across the  border twice in  the
last year with no major incident - same as the fact that I've  travelled
to the UK three times in the  last three years, again with no  incident.
The only reason that I'm unable to  attend the Las Vegas show is due  to
time constraints related to my job. Maybe a nice letter to DejaNews 
complaining of slander to my character should cure you of that 
embarrassing habit of not thinking before you post....

    my,your insults are getting lamer and lamer - like I said, I  was

job as the current president is doing an excellent job - why ruin a

    Just about as lame an insult  as "you will be eating your  spinach",
which is doubly stupid when you realize that a) I LOVE spinach, and b) 
you keep posting this in newsgroups full of Popeyes. Honestly, like

You lost me right here Michael. You think that someone should not be able
post bad content because it would hurt particular brands of computers? That
is obsurd. I also read the rest of your letter and the only thing that I
agree with is that Peter should not post advocacy in non-advocacy groups.
This group, by charter, is dedicated to "...attacking and defending Atari
computers..." and Peter has violated neither neither the spirit nor the
letter of this charter. His "flames" and "mud slinging" have been mirrored by
other posters and have been more personal in nature. The Atari advocates
certainly do not have the moral high ground here.

BTW, he is certainly a moron who annoys people but that can hardly be helped.

Yes, Brian, I agree - we should leave poor Peter alone.  He has enough 
problems knowing that Apple has just lost the US Navy and (something 
he doesn't know) my multi-national paper products corporation - who 
are not only stopping all purchases of Apple products, but attempting 
to dispose of the ones that they own - this is unofficial at the 
moment, but it's happening none-the-less.  This is all probably just a 
plot by the Atari Jihad, and other Atari boobs...  Why get 'personal' 
when you can insult everyone at once?  Including citizens of a 
sovereign nation that he continues to claim is but a state of another 
nation?

BTW - is it just me, or has anyone else thought that the iMac looks 
like a 1940's Popular Mechanics' artists impression of what a 1970's 
vacuum cleaner would look like?

Well, maybe it was to long winded and did not contain the proper 
sentence structure to get my point across. You quoted a statement made 
early in the letter, but go on to say you agree that he should keep 
his post in the advocacy group. The post that are outside the advocacy 
group is what caused me to express my opinion. The fact is that he 
will carry an arguement to whatever extent he feels is necessary to 
get a reply, even posting to the incorrect group, which he has. My 
point is that a hand slap is not enough in his case and he should have 
his user status at Dejanews revoked due to misuse.


>This group, by charter, is dedicated to "...attacking and defending Atari

Peter uses the group for advertising purposes. Consider what you state 
above, and tell me again that it is ok for Apple (he does represent 
Apple does he not?) to plug ads for their machines in an Atari 
newsgroup? Besides that point, how can someone honestly attack the Atari 
platform with the limited experience he has with the product. 99% of 
his post belong in the alt.rec atari group where the common thread 
is "The Jag is crap" headders. The person is here in attempts to cause
discouragement among the active users that care to read his post.
Probably only one percent of the active users even bother, but the group
is daily seeing new users come fowared, and here is where the issue lays.
A good arguement, sure. Even some good mudslinging. But it belongs in the 
advocacy group. And it would be nice if the person on the other end actually
had some knowledge of what he was attacking. He does not.

"Screw" the morals. It's been balls out here for a few years now. I 
don't care if he sleeps with Sheep. You want to know my moral ground? 
Since we're in the advocacy group where little kids don't belong, I 
think he is a piece of shit. How is that for a cro-magnum 'tude?

If he could channel some of that into constructively advocating Apple 
it would serve him well.  As long as he continues his present course 
all he gets from me are vague feelings of pity and a minor curiosity 
as to how many shootings of Morton Downey, Jr. & Rush Limbaugh he 
actually watched.  Same repetitious, loud-mouthed foundationless, 
blabbering employed by all three of them.  Hardly worth taking action 
against - although Michael did have some valid points IRT newcomers to 
the Atari scene.  Anyway - keep up the good work :)

Don't misinterpret me now - gloating was the farthest thing from my 
mind when I mentioned Apple's dwindling base.  I support them and hope 
for them to succeed - just pointing out that the signs don't look 
promising.

Maybe he should not be allowed to post to any group with *.atari.* in it
except this one? I wonder if Dejanews could enforce that... You know that if
he losses his Dejanews account he'll just start using a conventional
newsreader.

Actually, I think that he works for a retail company (CompUSA?) that sells
Macs and PCs.

Looking for knowledge on the internet is probably a waste of time :-) I've
been having a discussion with a guy in another group for over a week and I
still can't seem to convince him that preemptive multitasking is better than
the cooperative multitasking used in the Mac OS. It is amazingly frustrating
but I think of myself a teacher of the ignorant masses (well not quite).

I don't have a problem with it. OTOH, I try not to violate netiquette by
attacking anyone personally. I believe that, except for Peter, I have only
failed once.

    no misinterpretation intended - as a  matter of fact, I don't  gloat
over Apple's problems either. I do  highly respect the Mac to the  point
that I  bought  a  used Powerbook  a  few  weeks ago;  I'm  still  quite
fascinated by how good it is and how it's going to help with the job I'm
in (I needed some sort of PDA I could take to trade shows to take notes,
as well as a portable Internet computer  so I could do web searches  for
my boss whenever a customer needed some info that's not quite  available
from our end). The only things I've  been critical of have been the  way
the company has been run into the ground, the blown opportunites to make
the iMac  REALLY attractive  to  the first-time  buyer (that  is,  using
standard SCSI and printer ports so  that they, not Apple, get to  choose
what hooks up to  it. That and Sinclap's  constant obliviousness to  the
facts   and   his   bullying   behaviour   towards   Atari   users   and
hardware/software developers and merchants (you'll notice he NEVER posts
to the mac.advocacy or comp.sys.mac) - certainly he'd like the 
challenge of a REAL debate among his peers, especially those who really 
posts the truth about Apple's situation.

I don't have a problem with him in this newsgroup, at least as far as 
his rights are. I doubt that the letter I sent was even considered. 
Most of the time ISP's simply say it looks like your group needs a 
moderator........

:). You wouldn't know it to read his post. Anyway, might as well 
tarnish the resume before he submits it.

Yea, he has brought me to skullduggery a few times and I couldn't resist, 
but I try to refer to him in the third person whenever I can (even 
to him).

He needs to say away from the .ST, .TECH, and .PRG Atari groups. 
Unless he would like to use his wisdom with the Mac OS and start a 
MagiC Mac help list. But that would require an effort. It is much 
easier to just randomly look in newsgroups and type some stupid 
statement.
