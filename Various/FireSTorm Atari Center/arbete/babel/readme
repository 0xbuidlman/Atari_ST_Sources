Babel 0.6 beta
==============

Babel is a news transfer program for STiK/STiNG. It opens a TCP connection
to a news server and up- and down-loads news articles over it. It isn't a
newsreader, but is designed to be used with an offline reader such as
"FireNews" by Christian Andersson.

The file INSTALL gives installation instructions.

If you make changes to the source code that you think would be generally
useful, please send them to me. The output of "diff" would be particularly
nice if you have it, otherwise just a description of the changes and the
changed source would do.

Any comments and suggestions to me:

That isn't my only email address or the one that gets to me quickest; it is
the most permanent though. Alternatively, you'll find me on irc channel
#atari as markb.
