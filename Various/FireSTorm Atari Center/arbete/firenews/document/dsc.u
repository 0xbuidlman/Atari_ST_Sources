!subnode* *.DSC

These files are quite straight forward. They containe the name and the 
descriptions of the different groups that the server have. NOTE Not ALL the 
groups are in here, since some of them do not have any description.

group.name.1 description 1 (!nl)
group.name.2 description 2 (!nl)

As you can see, it is 1 group per line.
The file-name of these files are the same as the group-files, except for the 
extension, which is here DSC, instead of NGP.
