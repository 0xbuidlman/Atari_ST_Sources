Among my current projects is a DLL-like manager for the Atari ST family of
computers, from a lowly half megabyte 520ST up to TT030's with dozens of
megabytes of RAM, and Falcons.

I started writing it in 1991/1992, calling it "The Toolbox", and it is now
up to v1.22.

It was written in 68k assembly language, runs in around 32k of RAM, and
requires a 520ST or better computer, running TOS 1.0 or better.

It's almost finished, and ready to go off to beta testers, before being
adopted as an Atari Standard.
