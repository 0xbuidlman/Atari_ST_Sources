You will start with a screenful of soil. The line of icons at the 
top  and  bottom are for you to select what object  you  want  to 
place.
You  click on the object with the left button and then  click  on 
where you want it on the screen. You can hold the button down and 
use it like a paintbrush when you want a line of objects, etc.

Pressing the right button exits to the menu. This allows you to:

* Load or save a screen via a file selector window.
* Erase the screen (Clear Grid) 
* Swap  the  screen with one of 8 in memory,  so  you  can  flip 
  between them without using the disc.        
* Playtest the current screen.  The counter counts upwards so you 
  can estimate how long to give the players to complete it. Since 
  the right mouse button equates to the fire  button,  you  must 
  hold the right mouse button down and then press the left  mouse 
  button to exit.
* Set the title, password, time limit and quota of diamonds.
* Return to Edit screen.

Before leaveing the Designer Save your screen then Press -
' Conrol & C '  keys to Exit to desktop.
