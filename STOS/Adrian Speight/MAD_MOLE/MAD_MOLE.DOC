Also please drop me a line  with any comments,  suggestions  etc. 
on  the  game.  Although it's written in  STOS  and  has  already 
stretched the bounds of STOS a little, I have  now  bought DEVPAC 
and by Christmas I hope to be coding some more impressive stuff.

If  you would like the  source  code  for  Mad Mole,  along  with 
the cheat code (see later) and other  (less polished) games etc I 
have  written,  with source where possible,  then send me œ5  and 
I'll send you a double sided disc full of all my code.

Overview 
======== 
This  game  is  inspired  by  the  old   Boulder   Dash  game  on 
various  formats,  and if everyone has  one  game  inside   them, 
this  is mine.  I have included all my  favorite  features   from 
the  many versions I've played and added as many more  as   would 
fit  on the menu bars on the designer. So many, in fact, that the 
sixteen screens I designed don't really do them credit.  I'll try 
to explain them all in this DOC file.

The Aim 
=== === 
To  complete  each screen,  you  must   collect  a  predetermined 
number of diamonds.  In the  top-lefthand  corner  the  number of 
diamonds you have is shown over the  number  you  need.  When you 
have  enough,  the exits marked with a cross will  change  to   a 
tick which means you can exit.

Each screen has a time limit.  If  it runs out you die.  You  get 
points for diamonds and for time  remaining.  The top scorers get 
their  names on the highscore table,  which can be saved to  disc 
for a running tournament.

The Program 
=== ======= 
Just double click on Mad_Mole.prg and the main menu will  appear. 
This has three options:

1) Play Game. EASY   this lets you play in-built level.
2) Play Game. NORMAL this lets you play in-built level.
3) Help info. A brief on-line description of the main points.

The "Play Game" option 
=== =========== ====== 
Selecting EASY or NORMAL will take you to the High score  screen, 
here you can press fire and play or select one of the following :

M - Return to main menu.

P - Enter password if you know it.

L - Load a level which you have made using the Designer program.
    A  file  selector will  appear.   Navigate  into  the  folder 
    containing the screens (files 1 to 8) you want to play,  then 
    press or click on RETURN. The screens will load.

Play.
-----
Use the joystick to move around.  If you are face to face with  a 
bomb the fire button picks it up,  or drops it if you're carrying 
one.  It is safe to put a bomb on a stable surface,  but dropping 
them sets them off on impact!!!  
When you finish a screen, you will be given the password to allow 
you to start at the next screen whenever you like.
Also  note  that the left mouse button toggles pause mode  and  Q 
stands  for Quaff Poison.  For those tight spots,  the space  bar 
makes  your little mole face the other way.  This is only  useful 
for bomb aiming.

P.S. Beware of U235!!!!!!

P.P.S. There is a nice end-sequence for anyone who can 
               beat the eighth level.
 

The Cheat Code 
=== ===== ==== 
When  you are playing the game,  there is a code you can type  in 
which lets you use the keys 1 to 6 for six "Magic Spells"!!!

1 -- Destroys the contents of the square in front of you 
2 -- Swaps you with the square, hence you walk thru walls!
3 -- Sets off a bomb 2 squares away. Megablast!!!
4 -- You are now carrying a bomb!
5 -- The timer gives you another 50 time.
6 -- A valid exit appears to your right! Easy eh?
 
There  is  another  code which lets you start  the  game  at  any 
screen, regardless of password.
 
The code? Get my disc of programs and I'll give you it. Otherwise 
any determined person should be able to figure out what it is.
 
The Objects 
=== ======= 
I am tempted to leave many of the objects a mystery,  for you  to 
figure out for yourselves.  However, I will try and describe most 
of them:
 
 
Standard Objects 
-------- ------- 
MOLE -  You,  obviously.  If you place more than one then all but 
        one will turn to soil.

BLANK-  Rocks, bombs and diamonds fall through this area.

SOIL -  You can eat this without indigestion.
 
BOULDER-Can  be pushed and will fall and kill you if it gets  the 
        chance.
        If  it  finds itself on a rounded perch with  a  drop  on 
        either side it will tip over!

DIAMOND-Treat as a very edible boulder.
 
BOMB -  Always a handy thing to have.  It is safe while you carry 
        it,  and can be pushed, and will fall, but if it falls at 
        all,  or  anything  falls on it,  or it is caught  in  an 
        explosion,  then it will explode, wiping out all adjacent 
        squares.

BRICK  - Can only be breached with  explosives.  Several  objects 
         just function as immobile barriers. Some are flat-topped 
         and others are rounded.  Just watch where you leave that 
         bomb!

Special Objects 
------- ------- 
VAULT - Is impassible and bomb-proof.
 
RADKEY-  Transmits  the 'open sesame' code.  All  vaults  on  the 
         screen open, which for game purposes means they cease to 
         exist.

DETONATOR  -  Sends 'self destruct' to all bombs  on  the  screen 
              except  the  one  you're  carrying.  Can  be  very 
              colourful, but also rather destructive.

TRAP#1  No, I haven't reverted to DEVPAC. There is a brick on the 
        screen  (bottom  left) which is really  a  vault  and  a 
        diamond which is really a radkey.  It is just possible to 
        tell  them  apart from the real McCoy  but  imagine  the 
        surprises  people  can  get  when  they  eat  the  wrong 
        diamond!!!

TRAP#2  Another brick (bottom middle) grows widthways if it  gets 
        the  space.  The obvious trap is to have  a  narrow  gap 
        filled with soil, and then fills in behind the mole!

TELEPORT - Anything which stands on this gets hurled 4 spaces up.
        It has a safety cutout when the destination area is full.
 
FIENDS -The ever present left hand wall following nasties! If you 
        kill one it turns into a diamond.

BLOB -  Spreads gradually across the board. Rather than blocking 
        your progress completely, when it gets to a certain size 
        it starts dying off in waves, giving you a chance to 
        sneak through it. It will not grow on top of you.
 
 
Downright Silly Objects 
--------- ----- ------- 
U235 -  If you haven't guessed, this is uranium, and if this gets 
        blown  up  or anything falls on  it  then  it  explodes, 
        yielding a very large explosion.  It is also  cumulative 
        when others get set off.

CND  -  Eat  this sign and all the U235s  turn  into  diamonds. 
        Rather like making power stations out of  warheads?  But 
        lets not get political.

CREATOR - When the space below the flame this generates is empty, 
          it  fills it with a boulder or fiend.  Keep  that  box 
          closed, Pandora!

DISINTEGRATOR - The space above this is constantly vaporised. Not 
                the  most pleasant thing to happen if  you  walk 
                over one.

EARTH  CRYSTAL - When this multicoloured ore gets  surrounded  on 
                 all four sides by blank space,  it reverts to  a 
                 boulder,  releasing a powerful earth-force which 
                 fills all empty space with soil.
