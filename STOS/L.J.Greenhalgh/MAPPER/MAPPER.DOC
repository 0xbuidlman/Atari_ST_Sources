        Welcome to STOS  mapper  the  most  fully  featured map editor
avaliable for the Atari ST.  With  this  you can design scrolling maps
for use in your STOS  games.  Unlike  other  map editors avaliable for
STOS this is a fully icon/menu driven program making it easy to use as
possible. Maps are created using a set  of tiles, rather like a series
of lego  (tm)  bricks,  these  tiles  are  created  using  the program
maker2.bas/maker.bas  which you should find  on  this  disc and can be
constructed from either picture files  or  STOS sprite banks. Maps may
be up to 319 x 199 tiles in  size  and tiles can be any size providing
both the width and height are exact multiples of 16. Up to 10 maps can
be held in memory at one time and it is easy to swap between them.

        Each map can have up to three layers, the first layer contains
the value  of what tile is at each postion, the data layer. The second
layer contains tiles which  don't  necessarily  represent graphics but
can also  store  alien  starting/positons/objects/keys  or  what  ever
(called the scenery layer from now on) This is overlayed onto the data
layer. To achieve this the image bank  being used is split in two, the
first half being graphics tiles, the second being scenery tiles. Where
the split occurs can be decided  on  the  create map screen. The final
layer can contain numbers in the  range  0-99 it's up to the programer
to decide what to do with  them,  this  is called the info layer. Note
you can choose whether or  not  to  have  a scenery/infolayer for your
maps.

All maps have two files associated with them.

The main file is  called  (whatever).map  and contains the information
for the maps including the  data  for  the different layers. The other
file is called (whatever).min and is  primarily  of use in the editor,
it contains the name of the image  bank being used, where to split the
image bank if scenery  is  being  used,  whether  the scenery and info
layers are in use and what  the  width  and  height of the map is. You
won't normally  have  anything  to  do  with  this  file  in  your own
programs. The width and height  of  the  map  is also contained in the
.map file.


Upon running STOS mapper and clicking on  OK on the welcome screen you
will be shown the file menu which has the following options.

1.1     Load Map

        Choose a .map to  load  from  the  file selector, the relevent
image bank will also be loaded if  you  are currently at map number 1.
You will then be taken to the editing screen.

1.2     Save Map

Saves the current map if it exists.

1.3     Next Map

Moves you on to the next  map,  you  can  have  up  to 10 maps at once
although they are all expected  to  use  the  same tilefile, which has
been loaded into map 1.

1.4     Previous Map

Moves you to the previous map

1.5     Erase Map

Erases the current map

1.6     Quit

Exits the program, you will be asked to confirm, yes or no.

1.7     Create Map

        This is the most important item on this menu. On this screen
you can alter the various map attributes by clicking on the buttons.

1.7.1 Map filename
        Click on this area and  enter  the  name  of the map, the file
must have the extension .map.

1.7.2 Tile filename
        Click on this area  and  the  file  selector  will appear from
which you can select the image bank that  you are going to use for the
tiles. As the file has the extension .mbk be careful that you choose a
valid tile file, that is a control  image  bank  and not a stos sprite
bank or anything else with the .mbk extension.

1.7.3 Mapwidth
        Click on the left and right arrows  to change the width of the
map, max width is 319.

1.7.4 Mapheight
        Click on the left and right arrows to change the height of the
map, max height is 199.

1.7.5 Initial Tile
        This is the number of  the  tile  that  the map will be filled
with when the map is first created, the default is tile 1 but this can
be changed by clicking on the left and right arrows.

1.7.6 Scenery
        Click on this to change the scenery setting, either on or off,
after creating a map this cannot be changed.

1.7.7 Info
        Click on this to change  the  info  setting, either on or off,
after creating a map this cannot be changed.

1.7.8 scenery tile
        Click on the left  and  right  arrows  to  change the starting
scenerytile. If an image bank has already been loaded then you can see
the relevent tiles, the correct tile to  choose is the last one before
the scenery tiles start.


        After you have created a map with suitable attributes click on
done and you will be  taken  to  the  map  editing screen. Most of the
screen is taken  up  with  the  small  section  of  map  that  you are
currently viewing, on the bottom of  the  screen  is a strip of tiles,
the currently selected one is  denoted  by the upward facing triangle.
Click on with  the  leftmouse  button  in  this  region  to change the
currently selected tile. If there are more tiles avaliable than can be
displayed then clicking on the left or  right arrow icon at the bottom
of the screen will display further  strips  of tiles. The start of the
scenery tiles is denoted by a  downward facing triangle, this can only
be changed from the create map screen.

Tiles are pasted on  the  map  simply  by  moving  and clicking on the
appropriate area  with  the  left  hand  mouse  button,  the currently
selected tile will be placed there.

You can scroll round the map by using either the cursor keys, joystick
or by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen in which you want the
screen to scroll and pressing the right hand mouse button.

There are three other buttons on the bottom of the screen.

2.0 Tool Menu

        This has the following options:

2.1 Draw with tile
        This is the default option, clicking  on the map area with the
left mouse button causes  the  currently  selected  tile  to be placed
there.

2.2 Swap Tile
        Swaps all occurences of the  currently  selected tile with the
tile currently under the pointer  when  you  click with the left mouse
button.

2.3 Fill Tile
        Performs a fill operation with the current tile when you click
with the left mouse button.

2.4 See Whole Map
        This option draws a miniture version  of  the whole map, a box
representing the screen area is displayed  on it. Click on the desired
area that you wish to move to.

2.5 Count Tiles
        Select this option to  count  how  many  tiles of a particular
type are present in the current map.

2.6 Write Info
        If you have info selected you can assign a number in the range
0-99 to tiles on the map by  selecting  this. Click on the tile in the
map that the wish to assign  the  value  to.  Now enter the number and
press return.

2.7 See All Tiles
        This option allows you to see  all  the tiles in one go, click
on the tile you wish to draw with with the left mouse button. If there
are more tiles than can fit on one screen then <insert> and <clr home>
move you along the pages. Any key to return to the map screen.


3.0 Block Menu
        STOS mapper contains many powerful block functions.

3.1 Block Start
        Select this and the cursor  turns  into  the start block icon,
move the mouse around the map until  you have found the tile that will
form the top left corner of  your  block  then select it with the left
hand mouse button. A block needs  start and end points defining before
it can be grabbed.

3.2 Block End
        Select this and the cursor turns into the end block icon, move
the mouse around the map until you  have found the tile that will form
the bottom right hand cornder of  your  block  then select it with the
left hand mouse button. Once a block  has  start and end points it can
be grabbed.

3.3 Grab Block
        Copies the defined block into a  temporary buffer, you can now
alter the tiles within the defined block without affecting the buffer.
A dialog will now  appear  telling  you  the  width  and height of the
block. The paste block option is now automatically selected.

3.4 Paste Block
        You can paste the previously  grabbed block using this option,
a box follows the cursor showing the dimensions of the block, click on
the left mouse button when ready to place the block.

3.5 H Rev Block
        Flips the tiles in a block horizontally.

3.6 V Rev Block
        Flips the tiles in a block vertically.

3.7 Fill Block
        Fills the block with the currently selected tile.

3.8 Save Block
        This option allows you to save the current block

3.9 Load Block
        This option allows you to reload a previously saved block.

Map formats

You can load maps into either memory banks of strings as shown
10 bload "space.map",start(10):mapstart=start(10)

or

20 map$=space$(10000):mapstart=varptr(map$):bload "space.map",mapstart


Note the stuff below is highly technical and not for the beginner.

Each layer of each map has the following layout in memory, as an
offset from mapstart.

byte
0       I
1       M
2       A
3       G
4       E
5       M
6       A
7       P
8       (word) mapwidth
9
10      (word) height
11

so map_width=deek(mapstart+8)
   map_height=deek(mapstart+10)

or

   map_width=map w(mapstart)
   map_height=map h(mapstart)


The next  mapwidth*mapheight  bytes  contain  the  data  for  the map,
starting at the top left hand  corner  and  moving from left to right.
this layout is the  same  for  all  layers,  the  order is data layer,
scenery layer, info layer.

To find the start of the scenery layer the formula is
scenerystart=mapstart+12+mapwidth*mapheight

or

scenerystart=map layer(mapstart,2)

For the info layer
infostart=mapstart+(12+mapwidth*mapheight)*2

or

infostart=map address(mapstart,3)

See file control.doc for info on map read,map write, set map and
image map commands.

Do not attempt to draw a scenery layer of info layer using the image
map commands, most slots in the scenery map will be empty so you
should draw the tiles inidividually. Note that the values in the
scenery layer are given as offsets from the first scenery tile not
their absolute postion in the tile bank.

The layout of the .min file is as follows
string - tile file associated with map file.
scenery flag - integer true if activated, false not activated.
scenery_tile - integer ignore if not activated
info_flag    - integer true if activated, false not activated
mapwidth     - integer
mapheight    - integer


5 rem .min file format
10 openin #1,"space.min"
20 input #1,tilefile$
30 input #1,scenery_flag
40 input #1,scenery_tile
50 input #1,info_flag
60 input #1,mapwidth
70 input #1,mapheight
80 close #1


Keyboard shortcuts
help            - display lists of keyboard shortcuts
insert          - move tile bank one page to the left
clr home        - move tile bank one page to the right
spacebar        - shows value of current tile under mouse pointer
F1              - show all tiles
F2              - copies a block repeatidly over the entire map
F3              - disables/enables shading of menus/file selector
F4              - saves the map into a temporary buffer
F5              - restores map to version in temporary buffer, useful
                  for correcting mistakes when using fill/swap.
