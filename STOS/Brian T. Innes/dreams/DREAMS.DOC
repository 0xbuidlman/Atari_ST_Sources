High Resolution Dreams
----------------------

Demo Version! May 1997
----------------------


About the program
-----------------

     This is an extension for STOS BASIC, which provides
(ST) HIGH resolution monitor users VERY fast grapphix
commands, similar to those used in the MISSING LINK...

Of course, at the moment, this project is nowhere 
near finished....... :(


How To Use
----------

  First of all unZIP the archive (dreams.zip) on to a nice 
floppy disk...

  You then should have the following files:
  
                dreams.exp                The interpreter extension (DEMO)
                \examples\                Some example files...
                          manyspec.bas    
                          speck.bas
                readme.noo                an IMPORTANT readme file!                                  	 

Now What?
---------

 I dunno! Do you? :)
 
 Seriously, the next thing to do is copy the file dreams.exp to your 
'STOS' folder of you BACKUP/WORKING copy of the STOS package...
Then simply reboot your machine!

 Once STOS has loaded, you should see the following message:
 
'High Resolution Dreams Extension
    )c( 1996/7 Brian T. Innes    
          Demo version
            May 197'            

 You can then use the High Resolution Dreams commands!
 
What are the commands?
----------------------

  Here is a list of the commands
  
                rodenton                turns mouse on!
                rodentoff               turns mouse off!
                fastwipe SCR            quickly clears the screen SCR
                speck SCR,x,y           plots quickly at x,y on screen SCR
                manyspeck scr, x data, y data, count
                manyspeck scr, x data, y data, x offset, y offset, count

  And thats it!

So what do these commands do?
----------------------------

  Good question!
  
    rodenton and rodent off are commands (similar to mouseon and mouseoff in
the Misty Extension) which turn the mouse cursor & interrupts off! Save vbl
time!

   fastwipe SCR is a command to replace the STOS cls command!
   
   speck SCR,x,y  is a FAST plot routine.. I dont know 
     HOW fast it is though...
     
   manyspeck 4 or 6 parameters.
   
   	Now this is a rather jolly little command.
   	
   Say, for example you wanted to do some sinus dots.
   
   the usual method is to precalculate the positions and store them in
an array, e.g. X[] and Y[].  You then usually do the following:

       set start of sinus dots to zero (e.g. gumby = 0)
       keep doing
         for semprini = 1 to number of pixels to plot
             plot X[semprini+gumby],Y[semprini+gumby]
         next semprini
         add 1 to gumby
         if gumby > such and such then gumby = 0
       loop
       
   Well with my rather spiffing command all you need to do is this:
   
   pre calculate the dot positions
   set gumby to zero
   keep doing
     manyspeck  screen, VARPTR(X[semprini+gumby]),
           VARPTR(Y[semprini+gumby]), number of pixels to plot!
     add 1 to gumby
     if gumby > such and such, then gumby = 0
   loop!
   
   As you can see that code is MUCH smaller and MUCH faster
   
   See the example file 'manyspeck.bas'... It plots 360 dots!
   
   the other version of the manyspeck command is the same as the
previous, except you can add on a value to the x and y coordinates:
so a sinus dot that follows the mouse cursor... No problem!

  For more details of these commands, have a tinker with the example
files! 
        
   

  Possible future commands:
  
                50hertzmusic           plays psg music at 50Hz on 
  		                       a (70hz) mono monitor!
  		                       
                text                   fast text rout
                3dspeck                plots pixels using 3d coords!
                3dmanyspeck            ditto!
  		
  Of course, this depends on the feedback from you lot!

 only access my e-mail during term time!
