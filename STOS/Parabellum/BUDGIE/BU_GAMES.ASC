The following BUDGIE titles
are now available:
*****************************

- BU 1
DAMONOID by  Camy Maertens.
The first BUDGIE game. Entirely
written in machine code ( like
most of our productions ).
20 planets, no less,have
to be protected from Damonoid and its
invading fleet. Action is fast.
Time is running out.
Any enemy impact on your
planet causes havoc.
You can sustain 13
direct hits. But, should the Damonoid
itself land, the result
would be fatal!

-BU 2     
FOOTBALL 88 by Simon Rush.
A complete manager game.
Very addictive
Mouse controlled. Colour only.
This program has won worldwide
acclaim:
Game of The Month 
with 17 Bit Software
Game of the Year with
FloppyShop Magazine.
Being entirely Gem based,
this Football Manager is extremely
easy to play and contains many
features that sets it apart from
other offerings,
its multi-user capability being
one of  them.
If you are a budding soccer
supremo this game is undoubtedly
for you!

-------------------------------------

- BU 3
BLITZ III by Camy Maertens.
This is a bombing raid with a 
different scenario: three aircraft
fly in formation, all under
joystick control.
The aim of the game is to destroy
the city before too much altitude
is lost.
With each bombing pass, the altitude
drops inexorably.   On some versions
a rewarding bonus screen appears
after  each successful mission. 
This is a classic revisited:
it first appeared on the VIC 2O
in 1982.  Budgie UK have
added a new twist with multiple
aircraft and variable height control.
'challenging game...' ST Format Feb 89

-------------------------------------

- BU 4
OTHELLO by Jim Holmwood.
This is an immaculate implemementation
of the board game of Reversi.
It is entirely mouse controlled and
plays a mean game.  You may find it
difficult to beat the computer,
but this will maintain its appeal.
Two versions are on this disk:
one mono and the other colour.
 
-------------------------------------

- BU 5
PRO DARTS by Martyn Carr 
This is a mouse controlled simulation
5O1 down.       All darts addicts
will love this game and the somewhat
hesitant pointer 
(too much beer perhaps)
Speech commentary adds to the realism
Written in Fast Basic. One of the few
easy-to-get-on-with darts games for
the Atari ST.
Also on this disk, by the same author
FOUR in a ROW, a connect game of
seven columns.

------------------------------------

- BU 6
DR BORIS by Alex Dewdney
a TNT maniac is on the loose,
lighting  explosive devices in 
a maze of increasingly dangerous
alleys. You have 1O seconds to
defuse the bombs before
the inevitable blast.  There are many
obstructions in your path, including
walls and...skulls.
Also on this disk, by the same author,
PUZZLER
a diabolical brain teaser.
If you thought the rubik cube was
tough wait until the PUZZLER
reduces you to a nervous wreck !

-------------------------------------

- BU 7 
BALL ZONE by Ian Grainger  
An incredible Arkanoid type game,
only better.
Needless to say, this game is mouse
controlled and has many levels.
But the main attractions are the
time counter which dramatically
increases the tension and, also,
the reassuring presence of base line
tiles which will rescue you
in desparate situations.
The score is based on the number of
tiles and parasites destroyed and
on the time left at the end of each
level. This is an absolute must for
your collection!
The first ever Quality game 
written in HiSoft Basic.
Top Game with Page 6 Magazine.

------------------------------------

- BU 8
SPECULATOR by Camy Maertens
Here we have a true to life 
simulation based on real futures
markets.   Keep your cool as the
Index creates the drama.
This game is for up to three players.
You start with 5OOO points and have
to correctly guess the direction of
the market.
Trends develop, reversals occur
and sudden panics can cause havoc
with  the soundest strategies.
Everything that could conceivably
happen in real trading
is reproduced in this simulation.
The Index 'point and figure' chart
unfolds before your eyes and reveals
your profits or ...losses.
Any open position carrying an
excessive loss is automatically 
stopped. Closing balances are
saved to disk.

-------------------------------------

- BU 9 
TYCOON new version by Simon Rush.
A mineral exploring game.
The objective is to survey,
test drill and eventually exploit
various sites to extract valuable
minerals.   Mines have different
levels of profitability.
Other factors, such as world prices,
currency fluctuations and production
costs all have an effect on the
profitability of the venture.

-------------------------------------

- BU 10
MONEYSPINNER by Jim Holmwood
The slot machine is alive !  This
accolade winning Budgie UK classic
incorporates all the usual features :
nudges, gambles, holds, and some more
The scrolling is smooth and 
once again, the game is mouse 
controlled.
Entirely written in 68OOO code, with
digitized sound and hi-scores tables.
State of the Art gambling!
'A very enjoyable game to say the 
least!..'ST Action December 88
94% rating: STuffed Disk Magazine.

-------------------------------------

- BU 11 
MAELSTROM by Marvey Mills
A very smooth vertical scrolling
space shoot_out.
First, a meteorites field has to be
negotiated, then other weird
space objects are on collision
course with your capsule.
It's a matter of destroy or
be destroyed.
68000 code again.

-------------------------------------

- BU 12
ACE INVADERS by Gary Wheaton
The DEFINITIVE Space Invader !

to touch it, even commercial.

- BU 13  
ZENITH new version 1.1 by Gary Wheaton
A space combat for two players.
Poised at the edge of universe,
the two giant ships are set for battle.
Mouse v. Joystick. Several convoys of
aliens fly through space, wave after
wave. Your mission is to intercept
them.
Your opponent has the same ambition 
and his space ship has to be
destroyed.
The ensuing battle is a delight
for all arcade fanatics.
Another classic!

-------------------------------------

- BU 14
GOLDRUSH by Mark Annetts
A multi-level platform pursuit.
The aim is to collect the gold
while avoiding your pursuer.
Joystick controlled.
The puzzles are the main attraction
of this platform game.
This is the thinking man's version
of Loderunner.
 Also on same disk: 
ZERPHOD by Ian Grainger
3D maze challenge. Find the modules but
avoid the beasties. (one of them is 
an.. elephant! Nasty) 
The search must be completed before 
time runs out.

------------------------------------ 

-BU 15
LINE of FOUR by Philip Bishop
Although 68000 code is the native
language amongst Budgie programmers,
all other modern languages are also
worthy of attention. This great little
game is the first of two STOS
offerings. Line of Four is  of course
a Connect game. This one, however,
is a real tricky one. The computer
always seems to think one or two
steps ahead of you. Frustrating!

VIRUS GUARDIAN included.

----------------------------------

-BU 16
WORD PUZZLE GENERATOR by Keith Bearman
Medium res and hi res monochrome.
You can play the puzzles on your 
monitor or print them on paper.
Cheat (answer) grids are also 
generated. Puzzles, cheat sheets
and word lists can be saved to disk
for later use. Full on-line help.
Because of its expandability, this
program will keep you busy for
a very long time.
Jeremy Hughes' fantastic Font accessory
accompanies this program.
One MEG version, with extra puzzle
files available.

----------------------------------

-BU 17
MAKE A BREAK
by Martyn Brown of 17Bit Software
A truly exciting and colourful trivia
quizz with very strong snooker
connotations!
The questions have different degrees
of difficulty depending on the ball 
you decide to pot. 
Subjects covered are arts, the world,
books, sports, science, the past, 
music etc..    Can you clear the
table?  The game is one of the best
of the genre.    Version 1.1

----------------------------------------

-BU 18
PARABELLUM by Alex Dewdney
Confined to the deepest dungeon of
the underworld, you must progress
from chamber to chamber until you
escape. Finding the obligatory keys,
candles and artifacts is far from an
easy task as evil creatures lurk in 
every corner: your plight is daunting!
The is a challenging platform game
with remarkable animated graphics
and lasting appeal.
