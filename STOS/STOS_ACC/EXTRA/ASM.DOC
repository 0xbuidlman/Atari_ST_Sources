              Line assembler/disassembler accessory
----------------------------------------------------------------

                          Introduction

This accessory allows you to enter 68000 machine code 
instructions into memory. As the name implies, while each instruction 
is typed in, it is immediately assembled. This is a crude way of 
writing machine-code routines, but it provides a gateway to the 
basics of assembly language if you don't have a proper assembler. 
 
The disassembler side of this program allows you to decode 
routines elsewhere in memory:to disassemble the STOS Basic itself 
or even the ST's operating system.

                       Using the assebler

First you must load the Basic accessory file with the command:

          accload"asm.acb"

Press the HELP key and then select the appropriate function key 
to call up the asm accessory. The accessory will now load up the 
main program "asm.prg".
You will now enter into the line assembler's editor. From here 
you can assembler or disassemble using the following commands:


     A [address]    (Begin line assembly)

The value 'address' is the position from which you would like 
the line assembly to begin. You can express values in two 
different bases:

 1 Decimal     ->   10    145  800
 2 Hexadecimal ->  $0A   $91  $320
 
The pseudo-instructions of the assembler are:

 BDF num of bytes

     eg  DBF 200,0

 DC.n values

     eg  DC.B "STOS string"
         DC.L 20,$ffff62,2342,1000

 EVEN     (Forces the current address to be on a word boundary)

 ORG address

    eg  ORG $60040


     Z [address]    (Disassemble from address)

Press <RETURN> for screen output or CONTROL+C for printer 
output.


     D [range]      (Display memory)

Displays the contents of a specified region of memory. The dump 
is displayed in two portions : hexadecimal and an ASCII portion. 
Again <RETURN> for screen and CONTROL+C for printer.

     W              (Write a binary file to disc)


     CONTROL+C      (Exit assembler)

Pressing these keys will return you back to the STOS editor 
screen.
