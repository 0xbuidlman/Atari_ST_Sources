  All the perameters and various information needed to set up your very  own 
Diskzine  are  entered into the DCK.INF file ( in DCK folder ) by use  of  a 
word processor,  any will do so long as it supports ASCII text,  I am pretty 
sure that all WP's do!,

  All the instructions are in the DCK.INF file so please read carefully  and 
away you go,

  DCK is FREEWARE and can be freely copied and used by anyone,  no one  must 
sell DCK at a profit,

   DCK  must  NOT be used to produce a diskzine that is to  be  released  as 
commercial,shareware,licenceware  or any other ware that results  in  anyone 
making a profit,

  DCK must NOT be used to pass around or distribute anything  illegal,  this 
includes lists of cracked or copied software!,

  DCK must NOT be used for anything pornagraphic or articles that go  beyond 
the realms of good taste,  this of course may be in the eye of the beholder, 
but lets just say "try and keep it clean"

  If you do produce anything at all with DCK then please do send me a  copy, 
its a fair deal surely,  I wont be pleased if you produce something and  not 
send me a copy?.
