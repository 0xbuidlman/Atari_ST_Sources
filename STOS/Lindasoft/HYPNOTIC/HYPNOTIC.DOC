THE STORY...........

On a distant planet your people live extracting a precious mineral  from 
the underground.  Spheres of GI-Monium come down the ramp.  You have got 
to direct the red spheres into the red bins at the end of the ramp,  and 
the same with the other colours.
Unfortunately, the hostile inhabitants of the planet try to destroy your 
work.  Some  octopus  creatures  will descend to  explode  your  mineral 
spheres.
Click on the right mouse button to stun them,  but don't lose control on 
your principal task : deflecting the spheres to the correct colour bins.

SOME HINTS..........

Always try to stun the flying creatures before controlling the  spheres. 
To  kill bigger monsters use rainbow spheres.  Rainbow spheres  may  end 
into any colour bin, and give 200 points as reward.
You  have  three lives.  If you spend all of them you pass  to  credits. 
Click the left mouse button before the counter reaches zero.
